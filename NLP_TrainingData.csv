Apr-17,"['- By Dave Ahern          ""A truly great business must have an enduring \'moat\' that protects excellent returns on invested capital."" - Warren Buffett ( Trades , Portfolio ), 2007 Shareholder Letter            Return on invested capital is one of the best ways to calculate whether a company has a moat. Finding a company with a moat that gets a great return on its invested capital makes investing easy, not that this is an easy thing to find. The reason this makes it easy is the company can grow its value over the years and you can compound along with it. Helping grow your wealth as it continues to add assets and grow its business.  The trick to finding a company that is a great allocator of capital is finding a company that has had success in the past getting a great return on invested capital. The higher the percentage the better allocator it is.  Today we are going to look further into return on invested capital. We will take a look at what it means and how to calculate it, along with examples for you to follow along.  Let\'s dive in.  Definition of return on invested capital  What is a return on invested capital?  ""Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a profitability ratio. It measures the return that an investment generates for those who have provided capital - i.e., bondholders and stockholders. ROIC tells us how good a company is at turning capital into profits.""      ""We prefer businesses that drown in cash. An example of a different business is construction equipment. You work hard all year and there is your profit sitting in the yard. We avoid businesses like that. We prefer those that can write us a check at the end of the year."" - Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio), 2008 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting        Another great thought from Munger. I love this explanation, and this is a great idea to strive for, finding a business that is conservatively financed that can write us a check every year. Better yet would be a company that in addition to giving us a dividend would be a fantastic compounder.  Story continues  What are compounders? They are great quality businesses that can grow their intrinsic value at very high rates of return over long periods of time.  A business that can grow its intrinsic value at 12 to 15% over an extended period of time will create tremendous wealth for its shareholders over time. Regardless of what the economy does, or what the stock market does, or what the earnings reports say, etc.  We really like companies that can produce a really high rate of return on invested capital, but we also want companies that can reinvest large portions of those earnings at similar high returns within the business itself.  Warren Buffett\'s thoughts on return on invested capital  We are going to turn again to his 2007 Shareholder letter for some reference on his points regarding return on invested capital. I picked out some passages I thought were relevant. Buffett groups businesses into three groups according to his views on ROIC.  Businesses: The great, the good and the gruesome  Category No. 1: The great  ""Long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry is what we seek in a business. If that comes with rapid organic growth, great. But even without organic growth, such a business is rewarding. We will simply take the lush earnings of the business and use them to buy similar businesses elsewhere. There\'s no rule that you have to invest money where you\'ve earned it. Indeed, it\'s often a mistake to do so: Truly great businesses, earning huge returns on tangible assets, can\'t for any extended period reinvest a large portion of their earnings internally at high rates of return.  ""Let\'s look at the prototype of a dream business, our own See\'s Candy. The boxed-chocolates industry in which it operates is unexciting: Per-capita consumption in the U.S. is extremely low and doesn\'t grow. Many once-important brands have disappeared, and only three companies have earned more than token profits over the last 40 years. Indeed, I believe that See\'s, though it obtains the bulk of its revenues from only a few states, accounts for nearly half of the entire industry\'s earnings.  ""At See\'s, annual sales were 16 million pounds of candy when Blue Chip Stamps purchased the company in 1972. (Charlie and I controlled Blue Chip at the time and later merged it into Berkshire.) Last year See\'s sold 31 million pounds, a growth rate of only 2% annually. Yet its durable competitive advantage, built by the See\'s family over a 50-year period, and strengthened subsequently by Chuck Huggins and Brad Kinstler, has produced extraordinary results for Berkshire.  ""We bought See\'s for $25 million when its sales were $30 million and pretax earnings were less than $5 million. The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million. (Modest seasonal debt was also needed for a few months each year.) Consequently, the company was earning 60% pretax on invested capital. Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations. First, the product was sold for cash, and that eliminated accounts receivable. Second, the production and distribution cycle was short, which minimized inventories.  ""Last year See\'s sales were $383 million, and pretax profits were $82 million. The capital now required to run the business is $40 million. This means we have had to reinvest only $32 million since 1972 to handle the modest physical growth - and somewhat immodest financial growth - of the business. In the meantime, pretax earnings have totaled $1.35 billion. All of that, except for the $32 million, has been sent to Berkshire (or, in the early years, to Blue Chip). After paying corporate taxes on the profits, we have used the rest to buy other attractive businesses. Just as Adam and Eve kick-started an activity that led to 6 billion humans, See\'s has given birth to multiple new streams of cash for us. (The biblical command to \'be fruitful and multiply\' is one we take seriously at Berkshire.)""  Category No. 2: The good  ""There aren\'t many See\'s in Corporate America. Typically, companies that increase their earnings from $5 million to $82 million require, say, $400 million or so of capital investment to finance their growth. That\'s because growing businesses have both working capital needs that increase in proportion to sales growth and significant requirements for fixed asset investments.  ""A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a satisfactory investment. There is, to follow through on our example, nothing shabby about earning $82 million pretax on $400 million of net tangible assets. But that equation for the owner is vastly different from the See\'s situation. It\'s far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no major capital requirements. Ask Microsoft (MSFT) or Google.  ""One example of good, but far from sensational, business economics is our own FlightSafety. This company delivers benefits to its customers that are the equal of those delivered by any business that I know of. It also possesses a durable competitive advantage: Going to any other flight-training provider than the best is like taking the low bid on a surgical procedure.  ""Nevertheless, this business requires a significant reinvestment of earnings if it is to grow. When we purchased FlightSafety in 1996, its pretax operating earnings were $111 million, and its net investment in fixed assets was $570 million. Since our purchase, depreciation charges have totaled $923 million. But capital expenditures have totaled $1.635 billion, most of that for simulators to match the new airplane models that are constantly being introduced. (A simulator can cost us more than $12 million, and we have 273 of them.) Our fixed assets, after depreciation, now amount to $1.079 billion. Pretax operating earnings in 2007 were $270 million, a gain of $159 million since 1996. That gain gave us a good, but far from See\'s-like, return on our incremental investment of $509 million.  ""Consequently, if measured only by economic returns, FlightSafety is an excellent but not extraordinary business. Its put-up-more-to-earn-more experience is that faced by most corporations. For example, our large investment in regulated utilities falls squarely in this category. We will earn considerably more money in this business 10 years from now, but we will invest many billions to make it.""  Category No. 3: The gruesome  ""Now let\'s move to the gruesome. The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.  ""The airline industry\'s demand for capital ever since that first flight has been insatiable. Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it. And I, to my shame, participated in this foolishness when I had Berkshire buy U.S. Air preferred stock in 1989. As the ink was drying on our check, the company went into a tailspin, and before long our preferred dividend was no longer being paid. But we then got very lucky. In one of the recurrent, but always misguided, bursts of optimism for airlines, we were actually able to sell our shares in 1998 for a hefty gain. In the decade following our sale, the company went bankrupt. Twice.""  Finally, he sums it all up with this savings account analogy.  ""To sum up, think of three types of \'savings accounts.\' The great one pays an extraordinarily high interest rate that will rise as the years pass. The good one pays an attractive rate of interest that will be earned also on deposits that are added. Finally, the gruesome account both pays an inadequate interest rate and requires you to keep adding money at those disappointing returns.""  The master at work, he makes it all sound so easy, doesn\'t he? As an aside, his thoughts on airlines have changed a lot recently with his purchases of Southwest (LUV), Delta (DAL) and American (AAL). It is interesting how our thoughts about investments can change over time.  How to calculate return on invested capital  So how do we calculate return on invested capital or ROIC? Thought you would never ask. The setup of the formulas is as follows. I am taking the lead from the great Aswath Damodaran here.  ROIC = Operating Income (1 - Tax Rate) / Invested Capital  Where:  After tax operating income = Net Income + Interest Expenses (1 - Tax Rate) - Nonoperating income (1 - Tax Rate).  Invested Capital (IC) = Short-term debt + Long-term debt + Shareholder equity - Cash/equivalents - Goodwill.        Let\'s try this out on a couple of companies and see how this all fits together. I will use examples from the actual 10-k filings so we can follow along. Any additional formulas needed I will add so you know where the numbers actually come from.  Let\'s take a look at the 10-k for Apple (AAPL). All numbers will be stated as millions unless otherwise noted.  Solving for the numerator: Step One  After-tax operating income = Net Income + Interest Expenses (1 - Tax Rate) - Non-operating income (1 - Tax Rate).        Net Income can be found on Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Net Income = $45.687 billion  Interest expense  Interest expense = $-1,456  The tax rate is calculated by dividing provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. You can find both line items here on the income statement.  So, the numbers would be:  Income taxes = $15,685.  Income before taxes = $61,372.  Tax Rate = $15,685 / $61,372.  Tax Rate = 25.56%.        The last number we need is the nonoperating income which is a catch-all for dividend income, interest income or expense, or other expenses. This can all be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is where you will be able to find explanations and breakdowns of different numbers in the financial statements. For Apple it is found in Note 3 of this section and is broken down as this:  Nonoperating income = $1,348.  So now we can solve for the operating income portion of the formula.  Net Income = $44,687.  Interest Expense = $1,456.  Tax Rate = 25.56%.  Nonoperating income = $1,348.        Now plug in the numbers into the formula and we get:  44,687 + -1,456 ( 1 - .2556) - 1,348 ( 1 - .2556 ) = $42,515.59  Solving for denominator: Step 2  Invested Capital (IC) = Short-term debt + Long-term debt + Shareholder equity - Cash/equivalents - Goodwill.        We will find all of these numbers on the balance sheet, and I will provide screen shots to help you find them. Once we have them we will plug them into our formula.  First will be short-term debt.  Short-term debt = $3,500  Next up will be long-term debt; again this will be found on the balance sheet under the liabilities and shareholders\' equity section.  Long-term debt = $75,427  Now, we will locate the shareholder\'s equity which will be found on the balance sheet under the same section.  Shareholder\'s Equity = $128,249  The last two numbers we can pull from the Assets section of the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents plus goodwill will be subtracted out from the formula as they are not monies that are used to bring value to the company. Goodwill being a dumping spot for accountants and cash is typically kept in an account for a rainy day, if you will.  Cash/Cash equivalents = $20,484  Goodwill = $5,414  So we have all of our numbers, now we can calculate our invested capital portion of the formula.  Short-term debt = $3,500.  Long-term debt = $75,427.  Shareholder\'s Equity = $128,249.  Cash/Cash equivalents = $20,484.  Goodwill = $5,414.        Plugging these numbers into our formula gives us:  Invested capital = $3,500 + $75,427 + $128,249 - $20,484 - $5,414  Invested capital  Now to calculate the return on invested capital for Apple we will insert all the numbers into our formula and calculate everything out.  ROIC = Operating Income (1 - Tax Rate) / Invested Capital  Operating Income = 42,515.59.  Tax rate = 25.56%.  Invested Capital = $181,278.        $42,515.59 ( 1 - .2556 ) / $181,278.  ROIC = 17.45%  ROIC of Apple is 17.4%. This is an awesome number; ideally you would like to see anything above 15% so obviously Apple is doing something right.  Let\'s do that for a company that maybe would be struggling to define a moat.  Let\'s try General Motors (GM)  We are going to look at its 2016 10-k for our purposes today. You can follow along with the numbers that I will pull from its financials. It is on page 45 and will be under the income statement and the balance sheet.  10-k Item Numbers Net Income 9268 Interest Expense 572 Tax Rate 20.68% Non-operating Income 159 Short-term debt 29028 Long-term debt 84628 Shareholder\'s Equity 43836 Cash/equivalents 12960 Goodwill 6259        Now that we have the numbers let\'s plug them into our formulas and see what we get.  ROIC = Operating Income (1 - Tax Rate) / Invested Capital  After tax operating income = Net Income + Interest Expenses (1 - Tax Rate) - Nonoperating income (1 - Tax Rate)  Invested Capital (IC) = Short-term debt + Long-term debt + Shareholder equity - Cash/equivalents - Goodwill        First we will do operating income.  $9,268 + 572 (1 - .2086 ) - 159 (1- .2086) = $9,594.85  Next up will be invested capital.  $29,028 + $84,628 + $43,836 - $12,960 - $6,259 = $138,273  Now we will calculate our formula for return on invested capital for GM.  ROIC = $9594.85 ( 1 - .2086 ) / $138,273  ROIC = 5.49%  As we can see by doing these simple calculations it appears that GM does not possess a moat. As you start to dig into the numbers you will see even before you calculate the formula whether the company will have a good return on invested capital.  Final thoughts  The evaluation of companies is a many-layered process. You can use formulas like the one that we discussed today to start you on a path to discovering great investment opportunities.  We talked about the definition of return on invested capital and took some great looks into what some of the investing greats thought of this metric and their views on its use. Buffett and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) are two that come to mind.  As an aside, Buffett\'s shareholder letters are a treasure trove of information and if you are wanting to dive into his style and thoughts, they are must-reads. Plus, his writing is easy to follow and very enjoyable; he uses wit and charm to help make his points, all without sounding preachy or boring.  I must mention one thing as we continue our process to discover great companies in which to invest. You must not rely on one single formula to make your determination of whether you are going to invest your hard-earned money into this business. Instead, these are tools we can use to help us find great opportunities to make better decisions.  Our goal always is to find great opportunities with a discount to their intrinsic value so we can buy with confidence.  As we have seen through our evaluations of these different companies there appears to be a relationship between our calculations and the appearance of a moat. This requires further research into whether or not the numbers tell the whole story.  Sometimes, unfortunately, they do not, but they can be a great guiding force to uncovering the truth. As I mentioned in an earlier post, if it smells like a moat, it probably is a moat. But these calculations of return on invested capital can help you determine that fact a little easier.  There are tons of great resources out there if you are wanting to dive further into this topic.  Finally, I want to mention that you can absolutely do this. As you have seen in the last few posts, these calculations are not hard math. The most difficult part is finding the information to plug into the formulas, and once you have that it is fairly easy to calculate.  That will do it for this week. As always, thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope that you have found something of value.  Please share your thoughts with me as I would love to know how these formulas have helped you.

Look no further than Amazon\'s (AMZN 3.54%) recent returns as proof he\'s one of the greatest CEOs of all-time.  AMZN data by YCharts  In his recent shareholder letter, Bezos addresses the topic of staying a ""Day One"" company. In other words, at Amazon, it\'s always day one of a long journey. There\'s no day two. Why? Bezos writes:  ""Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death.""  Paranoid much? Maybe, but just because you\'re paranoid doesn\'t mean someone isn\'t trying to kill you. And in capitalism, someone is always trying to kill you (or, at least steal your slice of the pie).  Here are four techniques Bezos gives to stay a Day One company, and my biggest takeaways as both a business observer and Foolish investor.  1. Customer obsession  ""Customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied,"" Bezos writes. By being obsessed with pleasing customers in ways they don\'t even ask for – and thus can\'t articulate in a survey – Amazon is able to come up with revolutionary ideas that the consulting and survey-- based competition can\'t match.  For instance, no one ever asked for Amazon Prime in a customer survey. It was introduced in 2005, with great skepticism. Still, Bezos kept at it, and Prime hit maintstream in 2014 when members grew 50%. That has kept North American retail sales not only high, but accelerating. Amazon\'s North American retail segment grew 25% in 2016, a higher rate than the 23% in 2014, and off a much bigger base.  2. Focus on outcomes, not just process  Bezos stresses companies must not get bogged down in process at the expense of outcomes. ""Resist proxies,"" Bezos writes. ""If you\'re not watchful, the process can become the thing."" While not dismissing beta testing or surveys, Bezos writes great customer experience comes from ""heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste."" Not exactly something they teach you in finance class.  3. Don\'t fight the future  While big, disruptive trends are not hard to spot, Bezos writes they can nevertheless be difficult for large organizations to embrace. Amazon is certainly a large organization, at over 341,000 employees.  While Amazon began as a mere book-seller, today artificial intelligence pervades much of the company. Management\'s nimble nature and willingness to adapt has kept the company at the forefront of major tech trends.  Its Alexa smart assistant has been a massive hit and its Echo hardware has been hard to keep in stock, with some estimating the company sold 7 million units in 2016, more than double the company\'s original projection.  Not only that, but AI is also improving Amazon\'s core business with search recommendations, demand forecasting, and other aspects of ""old"" Amazon.  Amazon\'s rapid embrace of AI gives me confidence that even if we are destined to be enslaved by robot overlords one day, it\'s likely Amazon will be the company making the best robot oppressors around.  ""Watch this space,"" Bezos writes. ""Much more to come.""  4. Make quick decisions    Bezos talks here about not only making good decisions, but making good decisions quickly. ""Speed matters in business,"" Bezos writes. ""Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you\'re probably being slow.""  Instead of wearing each other down with exhaustive debates, he often ""disagrees, yet commits,"" to a course forward, and will correct later on.  Takeaways  Beyond the business lessons, there is a great takeaway for investors in these quote from Bezos.  As Amazon\'s share performance teaches us, one big winner held over the long term can make up for a lot of losers. I can\'t tell you how many retail and professional investors I\'ve known who have missed out on big gains because they could not get to 100% certainty on a stock, or were too scared to act, even though they were delighted by a company\'s products or services.  Legendary investor Peter Lynch once wrote, ""there is always something to worry about,"" , and that retail investors familiar with a certain company could actually have advantages over professionals. Do your homework, but don\'t be afraid follow your instincts and act with 70% certainty. Like the many projects Bezos and team are working on to expand Amazon\'s empire, not all investments will pan out, but that\'s why you spread your bets across several opportunities and let the winners create long-term growth.', ""Recently, Loop Capital Markets argued strongly for a stock split by Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ: ULTA), reasoning that a 5-for-1, or 10-for-1 split could increase the attractiveness of the shares for individual investors.  Despite the recent news of DryShips Inc. (NASDAQ: DRYS) frequent forays into reverse splits, stock splits aren't all that common on Wall Street. When thinking about stock splits, it's important to keep in mind why splits make shares attractive, what the mechanism of a split is and why companies don't resort to it more often.  What's A Stock Split?  A stock split is a corporate decision taken by the company following approval by its board to split its share. The decision to split shares could be based on a plethora of reasons.  The company could want to make its shares affordable to retail investors. This is especially true in case of highly priced shares such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG), etc. A split increases liquidity, which in turn brings in more buyers and sellers, helping a stock realize its true value.  Some companies offer other reasons as well. Kroger Co (NYSE: KR) announced a stock split in 2015, for the first time in 16 years. The company opined that through the split, it hoped to make its stock more affordable to its employees.  Amid all these reasons is one constant: the valuation of shares. Although stock splits increase the number of outstanding shares in the market, the market capitalization of the company pre- and post-split remains the same.  The Mechanism Of A Stock Split  When a company decides to split its shares, it makes an announcement concerning the split, giving out details of how many shares a shareholder will get for each share in the company currently held.  Usually, the stock split will be effected through a stock dividend. A shareholder would receive additional shares instead of the usual cash dividend, and those eligible to receive the stock dividend are the ones who hold the shares as on the record date the company declares.  Story continues  On April 23, 2014, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced a 7-for-1 stock split, with the record date set for June 2, 2014. The stock was to trade a split-adjusted basis on June 9, 2014.  Apple's pre-split price was $645.57. On June 9, the day the stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis, it ended at $93.70. Although traders may attempt to trade on the news, those invested long term may be well advised to stay immune to the hype surrounding the announcement and the returns on holding the stock long term may be far greater than the near-term, price-related gain.  Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) announced a split in April 2015.  Stock Split Losing Its Charm?  Stock split announcements in the current bull market run that began in 2009 are few and far between compared to those in the previous two bull runs between 1995–2000 and 2002–2007, according to a Bloomberg report quoting Credit Suisse.  What holds companies from being lavish in stock split announcements could be the predominance of exchange-traded funds and institutional investors in the realm of investing.  For an institutional investor, it wouldn't matter even if the stock is pricey. Another line of logic: When the stock price is elevated, it is immune from day trading, which introduces volatility in the stock. The egoistic outlook of some promoters, who would want their stocks to remain at stratospheric levels could also be a deterrent.  Will Stock Splits Matter Anymore?  Taking Chipotle as a case study, look at whether companies justified in splitting shares with the objective of making it affordable to retail investors.  The latest 10-K filing by the company revealed that the company had 28.77 million outstanding shares as of Jan. 31, 2017. Yahoo's database puts the float at 25.77 million. Percentage of shares held by insiders is 1.58 percent and institutional investors is 92.40 percent, suggesting that about 6 percent is held by retail investors.  If a company does want to keep this minority investors in the good books and in the reckoning, a stock split might be the right way to do it.

The company revolutionized the book distribution business, then most of retail, then logistics, then corporate infrastructure with its cloud business; it is currently setting its sights on India, TV and film, drones, artificial intelligence, and just about everything else under the sun.  Since the company is in so many industries and has a high-profile CEO who now owns a newspaper and a rocket business, it can be easy to get caught up in the daily headlines. Still, with the company at all-time highs, current and prospective investors may want to step back and appreciate the big picture. Here are a few charts that show why Amazon is amazing.  ""Your margin is my opportunity""  The following chart looks unlike any other company I\'ve come across, except for Netflix. That should terrify any retailer, especially those who have traditionally, you know, delivered profits, buybacks, and dividends to investors. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos once said, ""Your margin is my opportunity,"" and he wasn\'t kidding:  As you can see, Amazon has never indulged shareholders with GAAP profits. Therefore, it never has to take them away. This freedom from margins means that Amazon can go into just about any business it wants and disrupt it from below. Given that the company is branching out into basically anything related to retail or technology, it\'s a wide-open space Amazon can explore, equipped with the fastest horse.  It\'s killing the mall (or, them all)  The next chart shows Amazon taking sales from mall-based and other power-center retailers (Wal-Mart is left off since its $450 billion sales would skew the chart). As you can see, competitors\' lines are relatively flat:  Meanwhile, Amazon seems to be soaking up the extra sales, as the undisputed leader in e-commerce. While other stores are also investing in omnichannel and boosting their own online strategies, they\'re all playing catch-up.  Now Amazon is contemplating opening brick-and-mortar stores, taking on legacy retailers on their home turf: the in-store experience. Given Amazon\'s rabid focus on customer satisfaction, you can bet there will be something interesting about the Amazon bookstore coming to a town near you.  It\'s dominating the cloud despite competition  Amazon now has a cash cow, and it\'s scary: AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a small business relative to the retail segment, but it is growing like wildfire and earns 26% operating margins. In the most recent quarter, AWS grew a whopping 47% and now sports a $14 billion run rate:  As the chart above shows, AWS is the dominant first-mover in the industry. And while the secret is out that cloud computing is the future, competitors have not made a dent. The industry seems to be coalescing around AWS and services from Microsoft (MSFT 2.33%), Alphabet (GOOG 1.08%) (GOOGL 1.21%), and IBM (IBM 2.54%).  While those companies are growing market share, it has not come at the expense of AWS, but rather, from smaller upstarts. This is because, as the Wall Street Journal reported last weekend, building a cloud infrastructure costs huge amounts of money, and only the top dogs can compete. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet spent a whopping $31.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2016. That\'s impossible to compete with if you\'re not already one of the largest companies.  This is leading to what is known as an oligopoly with a strong secular tailwind -- a profitable combination indeed. According to Gartner, the IaaS (infrastructure as a service) industry is set to grow 37% this year, and will continue torrid growth for the foreseeable future. If AWS can just maintain its share, Amazon looks like it will have even more cash to deploy into new markets and opportunities.  Bottom line: Amazon\'s unique record of reinvestment and experimentation is a formidable advantage, and it is not slowing down.', 'If you\'re only thinking about your career in terms of what you have to get done this week, you\'re not planning your future — you\'re just working a job.  With the daily demands workers have to manage, it\'s easy to become exclusively focused on the short-term. But according to Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google\'s parent company Alphabet and former CEO, that\'s an error that could be preventing you from getting the most out of your professional life.  ""I find almost everybody, including myself, makes the mistake of making a short-term decision without thinking of a strategy for five years,"" Schmidt tells CNBC.

But investors won\'t have to wait years for Tesla\'s ability to execute on ambitious growth targets to be tested. In 2017, Tesla has three milestones on the horizon it will need to achieve to keep investors betting optimistically on the company\'s longer-term growth potential.  Look for Tesla to live up to these three important landmark targets for 2017.  1. Model 3 production  It\'s difficult to overstate just how important the Model 3 is to Tesla\'s stock price. With a starting price of $35,000, or about half the starting price of its pricier Model S sedan, the upcoming vehicle represents the culmination of Tesla\'s efforts to date. Ever since Tesla CEO Elon Musk laid out his ""secret master plan"" in 2006, Tesla\'s mission was crystal clear: Tesla\'s pricier vehicles were only a medium for the company to build a business that could eventually support production of a higher volume, more affordable vehicle -- the Model 3.  But it\'s 2017 now, and it\'s time for Tesla to deliver on its promise. As of Tesla\'s most recent shareholder letter, the company said it plans to begin Model 3 production in July.  Can Tesla pull it off?  2. Volume production of Model 3  Of course, Tesla is going to need to do more than begin production of Model 3 in 2017. It needs to ramp up production to a significant volume. With a market capitalization of $51 billion yet having only delivered 86,500 vehicles in the trailing 12 months, investors are betting that Tesla will not only begin Model 3 production, but eventually scale it to annual production in the hundreds of thousands.  Tesla has said it expects to achieve ""volume production"" in September.  What could the production ramp-up of Model 3 look like? Tesla gave a preview of what management expects in the company\'s fourth-quarter shareholder letter:  ""Our Model 3 program is on track to start limited vehicle production in July and to steadily ramp production to exceed 5,000 vehicles per week at some point in the fourth quarter and 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2018.""  For the entire year of 2018, Tesla expects the combined production of Model S, X, and 3 to add up to about 500,000 units.  3. Production ramp-up of solar glass tiles  Another key area investors should keep their eyes on is Tesla\'s ability to put its late 2016-acquisition of SolarCity to work. One of the first targets on the horizon for Tesla\'s solar business is bringing its new glass solar tiles to market and ramping up their production.  In Tesla\'s fourth-quarter earnings call, Tesla\'s chief technology officer, J.B. Straubel, said Tesla will ""ramp and start scaling"" production of its solar tiles by the end of the year.  For Tesla to live up to high investor expectations, it\'s going to have to deliver on these three near-term milestones first. Otherwise, investors will have little confidence in Tesla\'s longer-term targets, namely its goal to produce 500,000 vehicles annually by next year and 1 million annually in 2020.', 'For Tesla\'s (TSLA 1.46%) first quarter, one of the electric-car company\'s most closely watched metrics has already been released: Tesla delivered just over 25,000 vehicles during the quarter, up 69% year over year. But there\'s still plenty investors would like to know when Tesla reports quarterly results on Wednesday, May 3.  You can bet investors will be watching the quarter closely. Tesla stock has been on a tear recently, surging more than 50% in the past six months to new all-time highs as investors begin to give more weight to the company\'s upcoming launch of its first lower-priced, mass-market vehicle: Model 3.  Ahead of Tesla\'s first-quarter earnings release, here are three areas for investors to watch.  Model 3 news  One of the hottest topics going into Tesla\'s first-quarter earnings release is undoubtedly anything management says about Model 3. With the comapny planning to launch the vehicle in July, investors should look to see if management provides updates on what to expect from the vehicle itself, as well as from Tesla\'s production plans for the vehicle.  The Model 3 is critical to Tesla\'s plans to grow its business. Management expects the Model 3\'s lower price compared to its current vehicles to help Tesla increase its annualized production from a rate of about 100,000 units today to 500,000 units next year. Further, Tesla has said it expects the Model 3 program to see ""limited vehicle production in July and to steadily ramp production to exceed 5,000 vehicles per week at some point in the fourth quarter and 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2018.""  Capital expenditures  Of course, Tesla\'s Model 3 expansion won\'t be cheap. This is why investors should check in on the company\'s capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as any guidance management provides for the rest of the year.  Thanks to the capital-intensive nature of building vehicles, management said in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter that it expected capital expenditures to skyrocket during the first half of 2017. Management forecasted capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion during this period, a big jump from Tesla\'s $1.3 billion in capital expenditures during the entire year of 2016.  Demand  Another interesting area to watch will be any commentary on demand for Tesla\'s vehicles.  While Model X deliveries are still rising sharply each quarter, Model S deliveries peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015. Will recent price reductions to the starting prices of Model S help the sedan\'s sales move higher again? Further, while deliveries for Model X have continued to grow each quarter, are orders for SUV still increasing?  Tesla typically shares updates on the trajectory of orders for its Model S and X in its quarterly updates. So, investors can look to this figure to get some insight into how demand for the two vehicles is panning out ahead of Model 3\'s launch.  As far as getting an update on demand for Model 3, investors shouldn\'t count on it. Ever since Tesla generated about 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the vehicle within about a month and a half of its unveiling, Tesla hasn\'t provided investors with a new figure.  Tesla will release its first-quarter results after market close on Wednesday. In addition, the company will also host a live conference call to discuss the quarter at 2:30 p.m. PDT. Stay tuned at The Motley Fool for analysis of Tesla\'s first quarter after the update is posted.']","['While Twitter (TWTR) is still dwarfed by Facebook\'s (META 4.10%) social networks, including the core Facebook app, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram, Twitter notably has a key place among the world\'s top social networks. And a recent reacceleration in Twitter\'s user growth suggests the social network may still have lots of room to grow.  But exactly how many users does Twitter have? 328 million monthly active users as of last count, making Twitter the ninth largest social network in the world.  Here\'s a closer look at Twitter\'s user base.  Reaccelerating growth  All in the last two years, Twitter\'s user growth ground to a halt, turned negative, returned to growth, and reaccelerated to a meaningful rate.  As Twitter\'s monthly active users stalled at just over 300 million in 2015, the stock subsequently plummeted. Between the beginning of 2015 and the end of 2016, shares fell about 55% as investors considered the implications of the company\'s user growth challenges.  While Twitter stock is far from recovering from its big fall, the company notably returned to fairly strong user growth in its first quarter of 2017, giving some investors hope. Monthly active users were up 6% year over year and 3% sequentially. Investors took the higher-than-expected growth as good news, sending shares up about 11% after Twitter posted the results.  And it\'s not just Twitter\'s year-over-year growth in monthly active users that is reaccelerating. The company is seeing similar trends in its sequential growth in monthly active users and its year-over-year growth in daily active users.  Perhaps the most notable metric for investors to turn their attention to is Twitter\'s sudden and steep growth in its daily active users, which management happily pointed out in the company\'s first-quarter earnings release. ""Average daily active usage grew 14% year-over-year, an acceleration from 11% in the fourth quarter, 7% in the third quarter, 5% in the second quarter and 3% in the first quarter of 2016,"" Twitter said.  Though Twitter doesn\'t share exactly how many daily active users it has, the metric\'s accelerating growth is encouraging.  Twitter isn\'t seeing mass adoption yet  At least when compared to Facebook\'s social networks, investors should note that Twitter isn\'t seeing the same sort of global adoption that Facebook is. In other words, while Twitter is clearly an important social network, it hasn\'t become a ubiquitous app that most active smartphone users log into every month.  For some context, Facebook, which is the world\'s largest social network, has nearly 2 billion monthly active users. Further, Facebook\'s two messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger, have 1.2 billion users each. And Facebook\'s photo- and video-sharing app Instagram recently hit 700 million monthly active users. Facebook has the formula for making global, mass-market social networks down to a science, holding the top three positions in a list of the world\'s largest social networks, as well as seventh place.  At 328 million monthly active users, and with its user growth reaccelerating recently, Twitter is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. But the company is going to need to serve up more steep growth before investors start betting the service has the sort of global, mass-market appeal Facebook\'s social networks have been able to achieve.', 'Why did this happen?

AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko  HOUSTON, April 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson received compensation worth $27.4 million last year when he was chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, regulatory filings showed on Thursday.  Advertisement  He and other senior executives got raises even though Exxon's net income fell more than 50 percent in 2016 as the company, like many of its peers, tried to cut costs and weather a period of low oil prices.  The value of Tillerson's compensation package last year rose about 0.5 percent largely due to a 4 percent boost in his salary to $3.2 million and an 8 percent jump in the value of stock awards to $19.7 million, an Exxon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed.  The value of perquisites Tillerson received from Exxon last year, including personal security and a life insurance policy, rose 7 percent to $575,850.  Tillerson, 65, was nominated by then President-elect Donald Trump to be secretary of state in December. Tillerson retired from Exxon at the end of the year. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in early February.  Advertisement  As part of an ethics agreement when he assumed his government post, Tillerson forfeited unvested Exxon stock worth $2.8 million and potential for a bonus of $3.9 million. He also waived his right to retiree health benefits.  Tillerson's vested Exxon stock was put into a trust worth about $180 million at the time, the proceeds of which will be paid out over the next decade, much in the same way proceeds are paid out to all Exxon retirees. The trust is prohibited from investing in Exxon.  Tillerson will not be allowed to work anywhere in the oil and gas industry for the next decade. If he does, the entire trust's value would be donated to a charity that neither he nor Exxon chooses, according to the regulatory filings.  Darren Woods, Exxon's CEO as of January, saw his compensation rise 64 percent last year, when he was Exxon's president, to $16.8 million. Woods saw his base salary rise 36 percent to $1 million and the value of stock and stock option awards, his pension and company perquisites, including the cost of a home security system, rise as well.

And, over more than two centuries, the institutions that would later combine to form the current banking giant have played prominent roles in the growth of the U.S. economy. Yet what's most important to current investors is the fact that JPMorgan Chase has managed to recover fully from the financial crisis in 2008 and jump to new all-time record heights. With prospects for a more favorable regulatory environment for banks, some believe JPMorgan Chase could climb even higher. A look at JPMorgan's stock history can shed some light on how the bank has handled similar opportunities in the past and what investors should look for going forward.  Looking at JPMorgan Chase's stock history  Over the past 50 years or so, JPMorgan Chase has gone through some major transformations, but the stock has moved generally in line with the health of the U.S. economy. Strong performance in the 1980s gave way to a brief disruption following the 1987 stock market crash. Then, the bank generally participated in the huge run-up in the economy during the 1990s, topping out at the turn of the millennium and then pulling back at the end of the tech boom and the resulting recession in 2000 through 2002.  The most obvious formative event for JPMorgan Chase came in 2000, when J.P. Morgan & Co. merged with Chase Manhattan Bank. Yet that was only one of the many corporate combinations that have occurred during the bank's history. In 2004, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bank One in another key move that broadened the company's scope to include more exposure to the Midwest and Southern U.S. market.  How JPMorgan dealt with the financial crisis  JPMorgan's role in the financial crisis proved to be critical. The company acquired Bear Stearns in early 2008, in what proved to be just the opening salvo of problems that would lead to the near-collapse of the global financial system.  Of potentially more importance was JPMorgan's move to acquire Washington Mutual later that year. Washington Mutual brought with it considerable exposure to the mortgage market, and many argue that without that acquisition, JPMorgan could have dramatically reduced the amount it eventually paid in legal settlements related to mortgage activities. Indeed, moves from CEO Jamie Dimon to reduce the bank's exposure to subprime and derivative risk were instrumental in ensuring that JPMorgan wouldn't get hit nearly to the same extent as many of its peers in the banking industry.  How JPMorgan boomed after the crisis  In large part because of its positioning, JPMorgan quickly recovered from the financial crisis and saw its stock jump to new highs. Assets that the bank purchased at rock-bottom prices during the recession in 2008 and following eventually regained their value, and that put JPMorgan on a trajectory to regain all of its lost ground just a few years later. Since then, all-time highs followed, and shares now trade at about four times their 2009 levels.  One reason why investors can be optimistic about JPMorgan's prospects is that its leadership has its interests closely aligned with those of the company. Dimon currently owns about $600 million in JPMorgan stock, and he also has options that give him the right to acquire more shares in the future. Given the amount of leverage that JPMorgan uses in its business model, Dimon's holdings are a vote of confidence in the bank's ability to weather any future cyclical pressure and still emerge stronger than ever. Moreover, given the fact that JPMorgan shares pay a substantial dividend, shareholders have benefited not only from share-price appreciation but also from healthy streams of income as well.  JPMorgan Chase has used smart business practices and its good reputation to drive its business growth. With conditions appearing likely to become more favorable for the banking industry in the future, investors can expect JPMorgan Chase stock to live up to its impressive history and provide more long-term gains for shareholders."", 'When asked by Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Burnell during a conference call about the number of open positions inside the White House, specifically those relevant to regulating banks, Dimon interrupted: ""I said I\'m not interested.""  JPMorgan Chase \'s strong first-quarter numbers put CEO Jamie Dimon in a good mood on Thursday. But the air almost went out of the room on the bank\'s earnings conference call when the CEO, whose overseen a double in JPMorgan\'s stock price over the last five years, joked about joining the Trump administration.  The Trump administration has struggled to fill a number of key positions, including Labor secretary. Andrew Puzder, Trump\'s first nominee for the post, withdrew from consideration in late January. Current nominee Alexander Acosta\'s vote was still pending as of Thursday.  But Dimon didn\'t sound worried at all, reiterating his faith in Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Trump Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn, both Goldman Sachs alums.  ""They want to find the right people for those jobs,"" Dimon said. ""I gather they are talking to lots of people. But even after they announced it, remember they need to be vetted and confirmed, and that ... can take 90 days. So the sooner the better, but I think getting the right people is equally important.""  Dimon did get serious at one point during the call, saying current regulations are crippling many consumers\' ability to achieve the American dream and take out a mortgage, a problem he thinks needs addressing. ""I could care less [if] banks, the nonbanks do it,"" he said. ""My point about that was how it\'s hurting the growth of America.""  Watch: Dimon talks about JPM\'s performance', 'Paul Quinsee, Global Head of Equities at JP Morgan Asset Management JPMorgan Asset Management  Advertisement  LONDON — Mainland Europe represents an underexploited and potentially lucrative opportunity for investors, according to the head of equities at JPMorgan Asset Management.  JPMAM\'s global equity chief Paul Quinsee told Business Insider that while Europe is currently ""the most out-of-favor region of all global equity markets,"" there are many reasons to be optimistic about the state of continent\'s stock markets.  Quinsee oversees roughly £280 billion ($350 billion) of clients\' assets, out of a total of JPMAM\'s £1.4 trillion ($1.7 trillion) assets under management.  Europe is currently being ignored by big sections of the market because of one simple thing. Politics.  Europe\'s political situation remains hugely uncertain. For starters, no one knows exactly how Brexit negotiations will play out, and what exactly the implications of any Brexit deal will be.  Advertisement  Add to that uncertainty about the French presidential election, in which far-right, anti-immigration candidate Marine Le Pen stands a small chance of victory, as well as the possibility that Angela Merkel will lose her place as Germany\'s chancellor later in the year, and Europe\'s political waters are muddy to say the least.  Look beyond that huge political turmoil, however, and the fundamentals of Europe\'s markets are better than they have been for many years.  Quinsee says (emphasis ours):  ""Global investors seem to have largely lost interest in the region, deterred by poor profitability and the seemingly endless political uncertainty over the future of the European Union. Here we see opportunity; despite the politics, European economic growth is improving, and the region’s companies will also benefit as the global economy reflates. Additionally, financial stocks are still undervalued, with prices not yet reflecting improving returns, a recovery in loan demand and the likelihood, in some instances, of substantial return of capital to shareholders.""  Advertisement  Quinsee\'s argument is backed up by recent data. Just this week the unemployment rate in the EU dropped to its lowest level since 2009, and new PMI released on Wednesday suggested that the first quarter of 2017 was the eurozone economy\'s best since 2011.  Not only is the general economic picture improving, so too is the picture for corporates operating in the continent. European companies have been struggling for meaningful earnings growth in recent years, but that finally looks to be changing, Quinsee adds.  ""The real problem for Europe has been a lack of earnings growth,"" he says.  ""The same movie has played out in each of the last several years – the year starts out with investors expecting European earnings to grow by 10% and then they actually end up shrinking.""  Advertisement  ""Finally now however we really do think this time is different and we’re turning a corner. When tangible growth is finally delivered, that should lead to some of that risk premium being delivered back.""  These two factors combine to make Europe an incredibly attractive prospect right now, especially considering the widespread belief that equities in the USA are currently substantially overvalued.  ""With higher prices at home for US based investors, it’s going to pay to start looking further afield,"" Quinsee finished.']","['Buyouts can produce sizable returns on capital in fairly short time periods. However, the next red-hot buyout target isn\'t always easy to identify ahead of time. Of course, it\'s never wise to buy a stock simply because you think it might be acquired. But, a company with a strong enough business that it is sought by other companies may very well be a stock that you should seek for your own portfolio.  With this concept in mind, we asked three of our contributors which companies they think are ripe for a buyout. They suggested Geron Corp. (GERN 2.59%), Laredo Petroleum (LPI 0.83%), and Lululemon Athletica (LULU 2.72%). Here\'s why.  This small-cap biotech is packaged and ready to go  George Budwell (Geron Corp): Buyouts in biopharma are the norm rather than the exception. Even so, it\'s been oddly difficult to predict which company will be gobbled up next, with many takeovers seemingly coming out of left field.  Having said that, Geron, a small-cap biotech with a novel cancer-fighting drug called imetelstat to its credit, appears to be packaged and ready to go. Geron decided to license imetelstat to Johnson & Johnson\'s (JNJ 1.17%) Janssen at the end of 2015. After doing so, the company slashed its workforce down to just 15 employees and did away with the remnants of its R&D engine.  In other words, the company no longer has the capacity to rebuild its pipeline without a major success with imetelstat, and even then, the quickest path toward maximizing shareholder value would most likely be a sale to its R&D partner J&J. Building a pipeline from scratch, after all, would cost hundreds of millions in potential licensing fees, and Geron would also need to spend a sizable sum on reconstituting its internal framework for handling clinical-stage assets.  What might spark a buyout? Geron recently reported that J&J and Janssen are more or less satisfied with imetelstat\'s clinical progress to date. As such, the companies are planning on submitting a data package to the FDA to refine the drug\'s proposed pivotal-stage trial in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. If approved, this trial is set to start in the fourth quarter of this year.  To keep other potential suitors at bay, J&J may decide to pull the trigger on a buyout late this year, or perhaps early next year. Either way, it\'s hard to imagine J&J waiting too much longer given the enormous demand for novel cancer-fighting agents like imetelstat and the drug being close to entering a late-stage trial.  Time to cash in?  Matt DiLallo (Laredo Petroleum): The Permian Basin in western Texas has been a hotbed of merger and acquisition activity over the past year. Fueling the land grab is a desire by the industry to lock up as much acreage as possible because greater scale reduces costs and enhances a company\'s growth profile. That boom has been great for sellers, especially private equity funds, which have been racing to cash in before land values cool off.  While several Permian producers could be next in line for a buyout, one that stands out is Laredo Petroleum. The company controls a contiguous acreage position in one of the best spots of the Basin, which it expects will fuel 15% production growth this year. Propelling that growth is the fact that newly drilled wells on its land can earn 60% returns, on average, at $45 oil thanks to a combination of technology advances and cost-savings initiatives. In addition to that, Laredo owns extensive midstream infrastructure in the region, including a key oil pipeline, which an eventual buyer could sell to a midstream company to recoup some of the purchase cost.  Meanwhile, two things make Laredo more likely to sell than other Permian drillers. First of all, a large private equity company owns a third of its shares, and at some point, it will need to cash out. Further, the company\'s CEO has founded and sold several other oil companies over his 30 years in the industry, making it all the more likely that he\'ll exit Laredo via a buyout.  While none of this means Laredo will auction itself off anytime soon, it certainly makes sense that the company\'s owners would want to take advantage of a scorching-hot M&A market and cash in on the company\'s prime Permian position.  A match made in sportswear heaven  Rich Smith (Lululemon Athletica): Lululemon\'s fourth-quarter financial report fell well short of analyst estimates, but the company still grew its revenues a healthy 12% (helped by 4% increases in both store count and square footage), and profits grew 16%. So, even if growth wasn\'t as strong as investors had hoped to see, the company is still growing -- and at a respectable pace. This could make the company -- now nearly 20% cheaper than it was a month ago -- an intriguing target for an acquirer in an adjacent sector such as, say, Nike or Under Armour (UA 0.75%) (UAA 1.51%).  13 times larger than Lululemon by market cap, some might argue that Nike is the more likely acquirer. But consider how this might work as a so-called ""merger of equals,"" with Under Armour playing the role of ""accounting acquirer"" and issuing new Under Armour shares to pay Lululemon shareholders for their shares. The big worry for investors in Under Armour right now is that the company didn\'t grow fast enough last year, and it isn\'t guiding for much faster growth this year. But by acquiring Lululemon in an all-stock transaction, Under Armour would pour $2.3 billion in annual revenues into its own $4.8 billion revenue stream. That\'s nearly 50% more potential revenues for Under Armour -- and mostly to women. (In fact, combined with the $1 billion in ""women\'s"" sales that Under Armour did last year, a purchase of Lululemon would almost immediately balance Under Armour\'s sales between the genders -- $3.8 billion to men, $3.3 billion to women.)  What\'s more, these are high-quality revenues. Last quarter, Under Armour posted revenue growth nearly as strong (11%) as Lululemon\'s own. But Under Armour\'s profits declined year over year, while Lululemon\'s profits rose faster than revenues. That\'s a function of the higher profit margins Lululemon\'s yoga-wear commands -- 18.3% operating profit margins versus Under Armour\'s own 8.6% margin.  So by acquiring Lululemon, Under Armour could simultaneously (1) bolster its revenue growth, (2) balance its sales between the men\'s and women\'s markets, and (3) help to grow its profit margins at a pace closer to that of its revenue growth. Simultaneously, by bringing Lululemon in-house, it would add cross-selling possibilities to help jumpstart Lulu\'s efforts to sell more yoga-, training-, and running-wear to men. By offering to buy out Lululemon, Under Armour could enhance the value of both businesses.']","[""As investors, it's very important to understand how the companies we invest in make money. While this might sound painfully obvious, many invest in companies with only a vague notion of how they make money. To be sure, some business models are easier to grasp than others. For instance, even average consumers can tell you that Nike makes money selling shoes and that Coca-Cola earns a profit selling sugary carbonated beverages.  Other companies' business models are not so obvious. Take Visa Inc (V 2.55%), for instance. Since its IPO in March 2008, Visa has provided monster returns to shareholders, producing gains of well over 500%!  While the returns have been unquestionably great, Visa's business model is often misunderstood. While it might commonly be called a credit card company, that definition is ambiguous and doesn't really explain how it generates revenue. Without further ado, let's take a closer look at this market-beating investment and determine exactly how it creates all those profits for investors.  How Visa doesn't make money  Because a lot of confusion exists on this point, let's start with how Visa does not make money. As with Mastercard Inc (MA 2.81%), consumers don't actually borrow money from Visa when they use their credit cards to make purchases. Therefore, when consumers make credit card payments Visa does not profit from the interest rates charged by the card. The money being borrowed is from the card-issuing financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase or Capital One, and thus all interest expenses paid on a Visa-branded credit card goes to the card issuer.    There are pros and cons to this model. The obvious downside is that consumers pay a lot of credit card interest each year and none of that revenue goes to Visa. The positive is that Visa faces none of the default risk that comes from lending money. For what it's worth, Wall Street tends to assign much higher valuations to companies that do not face loan default risk. As a result, Mastercard's and Visa's price-to-earnings ratios are easily more than double of card-issuers' valuations like the American Express Company (AXP 1.67%), Capital One, and JPMorgan Chase.  The four-party payment model  Visa essentially acts as the middleman in a four-party model which, besides Visa, includes the card-issuing financial institution, the merchant, and the acquirers (the merchant's bank). According to the company's 10-K report, its annual filing with the SEC, every time a card is used Visa collects fees, as tiny slivers taken out of each transaction amount (it can vary depending on the card-issuing bank and merchant where it is used), in three main ways: service revenues, data processing revenues, and international transaction revenues. Last quarter, more than 96% of Visa's revenue was generated through these three streams.  Service revenues are what the company earns for services provided to card issuers for the use of Visa products. The primary driver of this revenue category is payment volume. In other words, the more a product costs, the more revenue Visa makes in this category. For example, a gallon of milk will not bring in nearly as much service revenue as a brand-new energy-efficient refrigerator. What makes this type of revenue special is that it is a built-in hedge against inflation. If the cost of widgets rises due to consumer inflation, Visa's (and Mastercard's) revenue will automatically grow right along with it!  Data processing revenues are the microscopic fees Visa collects for the authorization, settlement, clearing, and other various access and maintenance fees for its vast payment network. These revenues are based on the number of transactions that are made across Visa's network; not how much money is being charged.  What exactly do these terms mean? Well, the authorization is the process by which Visa routes the transaction from the point-of-sale to the card issuer for approval. The clearing is the exchange of the transaction information between the issuer and acquirer after a sale is made and authorized while the settlement is the facilitation of the actual exchange of funds between the involved parties.  Finally, international transaction revenues are earned for cross-border and currency conversion activities. These revenues are generated whenever a card holder purchases goods in a country different from the card-issuers country of origin. Because these fees make up such a significant chunk of Visa's total revenue, the company is especially sensitive to economic downturns across the world or whenever an event occurs, like the outbreak of a disease or act of terrorism, which can significantly hurt a region's tourism industry. It also means Visa is affected by the strength of the U.S. dollar more than most companies.  The Foolish conclusion  What I have found to be helpful when I only vaguely understand a company's business model, is to read the company's business overview section in its annual 10-K report. The reports are usually found on a company's investor relations website. Fifteen minutes spent reading this section is a great launching pad for further discovery and education about a company. Nearly all the information in this article was taken from Visa's most recent annual filing.  Understanding how a company makes money is a must for potential investors as it is nearly impossible to evaluate a corporation's prospects without knowing the different ways it earns revenues. It would be a shame to eliminate potentially great investments, like Visa, because of a lack of understanding its fundamental business model."", 'watch now  It only took one winter night for a Chinese mother to make the decision to leave her country. In the following two months\' time, she rushed to prepare $500,000 in cash, trying to submit all her application documents ahead of April 28 — the expiration date for the current U.S. EB-5 immigrant investor visa program. ""My child had been sick for the entire winter and the whole family got respiratory infections due to Beijing\'s haze weather,"" said Liu, 33, who requested not to share her full name for privacy reasons. ""When I was pregnant, the government promised to treat air pollution. Now, my son is already three years old, but Beijing\'s haze has only become worse,"" she told CNBC over the phone. ""I need a backup plan."" Liu\'s plan is to obtain U.S. green cards for her family through the EB-5 program, which is often called the ""Golden Visa"" by immigration lawyers because it provides a fast path for rich foreign investors to ""buy"" residency or even citizenship in the U.S.  The ""Golden Visa""  Firstly introduced as part of the 1990 Immigration Act, the EB-5 program allows foreigners, who invest between $500,000 and $1 million in qualified projects in the U.S., to apply for permanent resident status for themselves and their families. Generally, the money will be returned to investors within a few years\' time. Initially, the visa program wasn\'t popular — during the first 18 years, it had always fallen short of the program\'s annual ceiling of 10,000 quotas. In 2003, for example, the government only issued 65 EB-5 visas to foreign investors.  watch now  However, the 2008 financial crisis was a game changer. With liquidity squeezed and few banks willing to lend, developers found the EB-5 program a convenient way to raise cheap capital. According to the U.S. Commerce Department, between fiscal years 2012 and 2013, more than 11,000 immigrant investors provided a combined $5.8 billion in capital through the EB-5 program and supported 562 projects, which generated about 174,000 jobs in the U.S.  Growing demand from China  In recent years, the EB-5 visa program has seen growing interests from Chinese millionaires, with as much as 85 percent of the program\'s applicants coming from mainland China, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. ""Children\'s education, less pollution and transferring assets overseas are three top reasons why U.S. green cards are so attractive to many Chinese investors,"" said Law, an EB-5 immigration agent based in Los Angeles, who declined to share his full name for professional reasons. Law\'s view was echoed by Liu. ""Many of my friends have already submitted applications for EB-5 visas. A few years ago, only the Chinese super-rich were applying; but now, middle-class families are starting to apply as well,"" Liu told CNBC. ""Some even sell their apartments in order to raise enough money.""  Potential policy changes  Despite strong demand from Chinese clients, Law predicted limited room for further growth, pointing to potential policy changes under President Donald Trump\'s administration, stricter capital control by the Chinese government and the backlog of the EB-5 program itself.. Critics have called for the program\'s termination, arguing that it has been plagued by widespread fraud and political corruption, which might facilitate money laundering, investment fraud or even terrorist travel. The current program is up for renewal on Friday, and its fate now rests with the new administration and Congress. Although the White House has not provided any official statement on the program, Trump\'s earlier immigration actions have stirred fear among EB-5 visa applicants.  Getty Images  ""Many clients urged us to file their applications by the April 28 deadline because they are worried that the government will tighten visa rules, or even terminate the program altogether,"" said Law. In January, the Department of Homeland Security proposed to increase the minimum investment amount required for the EB-5 program from $500,000 to $1.35 million for projects in rural or high-unemployed areas; from $1 million to $1.8 million for developments in low-to-average unemployment areas. The increase in capital requirement, if approved, would immediately cool down Chinese investors\' demand, according to Law. ""Most applicants just can\'t afford that much money,"" said Law. ""Among my clients, nine out of 10 are investing in the $500,000 program. They are staying in China and are totally thrown into passivity. EB-5 projects are not risk-free — investing more money means higher risks.""  Stricter capital control  And stricter capital control measures by the Chinese government might make money transfer more difficult. In China, the currency exchange quota for individuals remains $50,000 per person per year, but most Chinese EB-5 visa applicants use two ways to avoid currency restrictions. The first is to transfer through underground banks, and the other is called ""Ants Moving House,"" which means to recruit friends or family members to exchange currency and transfer funds overseas. ""Now, you only need 10 people for an amount of $500,000, but you might need to find another 17 people if the new policy increases capital requirement,"" said Law. ""The Chinese government is going after such transfers and will impose stricter control."" Law told CNBC that his company plans to slowly withdraw the EB-5 visa services on the concern that tightening immigration policies under the Trump administration will cool down the visa business.  \'The long wait\' might be shorter']","['As one of the biggest consumer products companies around, Procter & Gamble (PG 0.11%) likely earns at least a small piece of your monthly spending budget. After all, it owns a dominant share of staple industries including shaving, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and diapers.  Yet this nearly 180-year-old business can still pack surprises for investors. Here are a few key operating trends and facts that you may not know about P&G.  Shrinking sales  Annual revenue has declined sharply in each of the last two years. In fact, fiscal 2016 marked P&G\'s lowest sales point since 2006.  Part of this brutal decline is due to missteps by the company that have led to significant market share drops. Its shaving business, for example, owns 65% of the global market today compared to 70% in fiscal 2013.  A bigger contributor to the sluggishness has been strategic, though. P&G shed over 100 brands from its portfolio in the past few years in a bid to become leaner, faster, and more profitable. As a result, it cleaved off about 15% of its sales base, but only about 5% of profits.  Targeting simplicity  P&G\'s strategy goes well beyond just removing its underperforming brands. Executives are nearly done with a complete reboot of how it does business. Every aspect of its operations, from manufacturing to advertising to shipping logistics, has seen a sharp reduction in complexity.  ""We are a much simpler company,"" executives boasted in a recent investor presentation, with the number of manufacturing platforms down 50%, category/country combinations slashed by 70%, and 30% fewer employees.  Market-beating profits  Even though its sales base is down 11% in the last five years, P&G generated roughly the same total earnings in 2016, $10.5 billion, that it did back in fiscal 2012. Rising profitability has neutralized the slump as P&G\'s net operating margin passed 15% of sales last year.  The improvements put the company near the top of the list in its industry, beating rival Kimberly-Clark by a solid margin.  Dividend follies  P&G\'s 60-year dividend streak makes it one of the longest-running payouts in the market. Yet many investors might not know that this historic dividend recently accounted for over 100% of the company\'s annual earnings. The company paid out $2.59 per share in dividends in fiscal 2015 compared to $2.44 per share of profit.  P&G\'s dividend cushion slumped as the company booked one-time losses from discontinued business lines and foreign currency devaluations against the U.S. dollar. Thus, the dividend was never in as much trouble as reported earnings would suggest.  On the other hand, a $9 billion windfall from its beauty brand sales this year are temporarily swinging earnings -- and the payout ratio -- in the other direction. Adjusting for all of this noise, P&G\'s payout promise has held roughly consistent at an elevated, but not unmanageable, two thirds of earnings.  Capital returns  So far, cash returns are the most direct shareholder benefit to come out of P&G\'s strategic transformation. The combination of big brand sales, including multibillion-dollar franchises like Duracell, and the desire by management to simplify the business, has resulted in a transfer of a significant portion of the company to owners in the form of stock repurchases and dividends. P&G is on pace to deliver $18 billion of capital per year to its owners since the process started, including $22 billion in fiscal 2017 alone, for a total of $70 billion in fiscal 2016 through 2019.  The good news for investors is that the program pushed up their total returns through a period of unusually weak operating results. But now comes the real test: whether the company can return to the type of steady market share gains that powered its impressive long-term growth before the recent downturn.']","['Most consumers know Mastercard Inc (MA 2.81%) as the plastic rectangle in their wallet that they can whip out in a moment\'s notice to make a purchase. Others might know that the Mastercard logo emblazoned on their credit and debit cards just represents the payment network used to move money from the issuing bank to the merchant\'s bank every time a purchase is made. However, even savvy investors might not know these five lesser-known facts about the payment network mega cap.  1. The Interbank Card Association and Master Charge  In 1966 a group of California banks including Wells Fargo, United California Bank, Crocker National Bank, and the Bank of California formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). Soon thereafter the Marine Midland Bank and First National City Bank joined the ICA. The ICA introduced Master Charge: The Interbank Card in 1969. It was not until 1979 that the card was officially named Mastercard.  2. Early international alliances and deals  In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard formed an alliance which basically allowed the Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network and for Master Charge to be accepted on the Eurocard network. In 1972, the British Access card joined the coalition of payment networks, effectively giving the cards a reach across all of Europe and North America.  In 1992, Mastercard and Eurocard launched a joint venture, Maestro International. In 2002, Mastercard and Eurocard merged under the Mastercard umbrella. Mastercard acquired Access in 1996.  3. Mastercard\'s amazing post-IPO run  In 2006, Mastercard, which had been organized as a bank cooperative, went public with an IPO price of $39. When its 10-for-1 stock split in 2014 is considered, this means Mastercard\'s stock price has risen well over 2,000% since going public just a little more than ten years ago.  4. Mastercard\'s antitrust lawsuits  Mastercard and Visa Inc (V 2.55%) have probably faced more antitrust litigation than any other duo of companies. ATM operators basically claimed that the companies fixed ATM access fees. Last November, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by Mastercard and Visa to dismiss the lawsuits. The case is still working its way through the court system.  In 2012, a federal court approved a record settlement of $5.7 billion to a 2005 lawsuit against Mastercard and Visa filed by a number of retailers. The litigation alleged the credit card companies conspired to fix fees charged to retailers for negotiating credit card transactions. Despite the record settlement, many merchants were not happy with the deal and have successfully appealed to have it overturned. This case is also pending.  In other countries around the globe, Mastercard and Visa have faced a number of similar lawsuits.  5. Mastercard\'s secret revenue generator  Most people have at least a glancing understanding of Mastercard\'s main revenue maker. Mastercard makes money every time a consumer uses the network to make a purchase. For every transaction, the company earns a transaction processing fee and a domestic assessment fee or cross border volume fee, dependent on whether the transaction was negotiated in the country of origin of the issuing bank. These revenue channels collectively represent more than 80% of Mastercard\'s revenues.  The remainder of Mastercard\'s revenue comes from what the company unceremoniously calls ""Other Revenues"" in its quarterly earning presentations. This revenue category represents a number of services and products Mastercard offers to its card-issuing banks including data analytics, loyalty and reward program management, fraud protection services, and consulting and research.  The kicker is that this umbrella of miscellaneous services is Mastercard\'s fastest growing revenue category; last quarter alone, the category accounted for $724 million in revenue, a 21% year over year increase.  The Foolish conclusion  Sometimes, much can be learned by studying a company\'s past. In Mastercard\'s case this is especially true. First, we learn that its focus on international growth began early in the company\'s life, when it first made alliances with Eurocard and Access in the late 1960s and early 1970s; the company\'s global effort continues to this day. Not only does its capable CEO Ajay Banga hail from India but some of the company\'s most innovative products are being offered in a variety of emerging markets. For instance, Mastercard has a deal with several African governments to link government-issued ID cards to national mobile wallets. Other recent deals include partnerships with the Bank of Ireland, a mobile platform for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and the First Bank of Nigeria.  Investors can also learn that one of Mastercard\'s unique threats is the large number of massive lawsuits brought against it by retailers, which could be an ongoing threat to the company and should be something that all shareholders keep a close eye on.  Perhaps, most importantly, Mastercard shareholders can learn that the credit card giant is quietly building sticky services that fall well outside of its clients\' wheelhouses. Not only are these services rapidly growing revenue, but they make Mastercard\'s customers ever more reliant on the company, making it that much more difficult for a bank or financial institution to sever its ties to the payment network.', 'The days of tapping in your PIN at the checkout could be numbered after credit card provider Mastercard unveiled a payment card in South Africa featuring a biometric fingerprint scanner.  Mastercard, which processes more than 65,000 transactions every minute worldwide, made the announcement on Thursday following two successful trials in South Africa.    The technology works in a similar way to mobile phone payments, in which users must hold their finger over the sensor whilst making a purchase. Instead of a card user entering in their four-digit personal identification number (PIN), the payment card features a small biometric area designed to verify the user\'s fingerprint.  ""It\'s not something that can be taken or replicated and will help our cardholders get on with their lives knowing their payments are protected,"" Ajay Bhalla, president of enterprise risk and security at Mastercard, said in a statement.  The payment network said it is currently extending the trial process and hopes to fully implement the technology throughout Europe and Asia later this year.  While fingerprint recognition is widely considered as a safer and more efficient way of payment authentication than PINs, analysts at Berlin-based Security Research Labs had previously hacked scanners such as the ones used by Samsung \'s Galaxy S5.  ""Consumers are increasingly experiencing the convenience and security of biometrics (and) the fingerprint is helping to deliver additional convenience and security,"" Bhalla added.', 'This article was updated on June 23, 2018.  If you\'re trying to rebuild credit, a secured credit card is a much better choice for your electronic payment needs than a debit card. With a secured credit card, you\'ll have a line of credit at least equal to your security deposit, and as you establish good credit behavior with the card, your credit score could begin to rise.  Secured credit cards 101  In most ways, secured credit cards work just like standard credit card products. They have a predetermined spending limit, an interest rate, and they are part of a major payment processing network (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover), and therefore are accepted just like standard credit cards.  The major difference is that in order to get the card, you\'ll need to put up a security deposit, typically equal to the card\'s credit limit. In many cases, this can be as low as a few hundred dollars or as high as several thousand. This deposit is placed in an escrow account, and is used to ""secure"" any debts you incur on the card. If you default on your credit card debt, the issuer has this money in reserve, which can be used to settle the bill. If you pay your credit card bill as agreed, your security deposit remains in the escrow account.  Many secured credit cards allow you to request a refund of your security deposit after establishing a strong payment history, but in all cases, you have the ability to close your account and receive your deposit back, minus any money you owe on the card.  Because you\'re coming up with a security deposit in order to get the card, you\'re not considered to be particularly high risk to the credit card issuer. For this reason, secured cards tend to come with competitive annual fees and interest rates, especially when compared to other credit card products designed for people with shaky credit histories.  Advantages over debit and prepaid cards  Many people with shaky credit histories use debit cards or prepaid credit cards for their electronic payment needs. While it\'s understandable why people use this option -- they are accepted at most merchants and don\'t require a big initial deposit -- there are some major advantages to using a secured credit card instead.  To name a few:  Secured credit cards are reported to the three major credit bureaus, just like standard credit cards. In fact, there\'s no ""secured"" distinction when a secured card is reported. Because of this, secured credit cards can help build or rebuild your credit.  There are some types of merchants that want a credit card, not a debit/prepaid card. For example, it can be extremely difficult or costly to rent a car or get a hotel room without a credit card.  While there are exceptions, credit cards generally have better consumer protections than debit cards. In other words, if you are a victim of fraud, it can be easier to solve the problem if the fraudulent purchases were made on a credit card.  Examples of secured credit cards and what to look for  The two main things to look for when choosing a secured credit card are a reasonable annual fee and a competitive interest rate. However, be sure to consider all of a card\'s features before making a decision.  For example, if you get a secured credit card issued by the bank you use for your checking and savings accounts, you may be able to link your credit card to your bank account, adding an element of convenience. Another example is that some secured credit cards may offer rewards, such as cash back or airline miles.  For example, Bank of America\'s BankAmericard® Secured Credit Card charges a $39 annual fee and has a 20.99% interest rate as of this writing, which is on the high end but not excessive. You can choose to deposit $300-$4,900 to secure the card, and one of my favorite features of the card is the ability to get your deposit returned after 12 months of good performance.  Here are a few more examples of our favorite secured credit cards.']","['InSphero 3D InSight™ Human Liver Microtissues provide greater confidence to pharmaceutical drug discovery and development groups in their efforts to predict drug-induced liver injury in vitro prior to testing in animals or patients.Click here for high-resolution version  SCHLIEREN, SWITZERLAND--(Marketwired - April 27, 2017) - InSphero AG, the leading supplier of assay-ready 3D cell culture models for accelerating drug discovery and development, has entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc. (PFE), one of the world\'s premier biopharmaceutical companies, to develop a novel predictive toxicology assay using InSphero 3D InSight™ Human Liver Microtissues.

But as we head into the spring home-buying season, clouds are forming on the horizon.  Mortgage rates are rising, there's a shortage of available housing to meet the demand, and new housing starts are dropping. That's a double-edged sword for the home-building supply warehouses because on one hand, they cater to the professional contractors building the homes, but on the other, do-it-yourselfers and home remodeling still comprise a big part of their business. Business from the one might fall, but it could rise from the other.  With this changeable environment confronting the two biggest big-box stores in the home-improvement industry, let's see whether Home Depot or Lowe's makes for the better buy.  Growth prospects  Despite their apparent similarities, Home Depot is the bigger and more profitable of the two. While they have about the same number of stores in operation, Lowe's generates about a third less revenue, 60% less operating income, and half the free cash flow. That's because Home Depot tilts more toward the professional contractor -- who tend to buy higher value items -- while Lowe's leans more toward the homeowner.  With housing having enjoyed a really robust 2016, which has been called the best year in a decade for the market, it's understandable that Home Depot edges out its rival. Yet with the changes underway in the industry, the field might begin to tilt now in Lowe's favor.  Housing prices are rising, and with mortgage rates going up -- not to mention the number of homeowners still underwater on their mortgages -- moving on might not be an option for many. It will be tough to give up those lower rates homeowners have enjoyed, and with staying put comes the decision to fix up what you've got. The tides of renovation and remodeling will lift the boats of both Home Depot and Lowe's, but Lowe's business model specifically favors homeowners, meaning it may rise higher.  Home Depot Lowe's Product Category % Total Sales Product Category % Total Sales Indoor Garden 9.4% Lumber & Building Materials 12% Paint 8.4% Tools & Hardware 11% Kitchen & Bath 7.8% Appliances 11% Outdoor Garden 7.4% Fashion Fixtures 10% Appliances 7.4% Rough Plumbing & Electrical 9%  Lowe's leading position in appliances and fashion fixtures may help it edge out its rival in gains for those who can't or won't sell their homes.  Performance and valuation  The stocks of the two companies might not walk in lockstep, but they're still pretty similar. However, after Lowe's recent earnings report, the market rewarded it with a big surge higher that puts the one-year gains of both companies almost on par with each other.  On a trailing-12-month basis, both Home Depot and Lowe's are comparably valued at around 23 times earnings, but when looking out over the next 12 months, Lowe's gains an edge with its price at about 15 times next year's profits versus Home Depot's 18 times earnings, though both are attractively priced in relation to the S&P 500 as a whole at 26 times earnings.  Still, Lowe's is expected to grow earnings at a 15% annual clip over the next five years compared to less than 12% for Home Depot. With macroeconomic trends moving in its favor, Lowe's has the advantage, here.  Dividends  Both companies have their strengths when returning value to shareholders through dividend payments. Home Depot, for example, pays a dividend of $3.56 per share annually, reflecting the big 29% hike in the payout it just approved for the year. It currently yields about 2.4%.  Lowe's dividend of $1.40 per share annually and yield of 1.7% seem much more mundane, but the DIY retailer has an impressive record of paying a dividend every year since it became a public company in 1961, as well as raising the payout every year for 54 straight years.  The verdict  Both companies have done well as housing finally recovered after the financial markets collapsed, and recent trends worked in favor of Home Depot's business. But things are changing once more -- and seeming to tilt in Lowe's favor now.  While both big-box retailers are likely to do well regardless, the economic variables and Lowe's lower and better valuation -- particularly in relation to its future earnings growth estimates -- make it the better choice, however slightly.""]","['A customer shops inside a Costco Wholesale Corp. store in Miami, Florida. (Scott McIntyre/Bloomberg/Getty Images/CNBC)  The popularity of wholesale retailer Costco is undeniable, especially if you’ve ever been fighting for parking outside one on a Saturday, or attended a Costco-themed birthday party.  But all that popularity also means that the original purpose, a wholesaler for small businesses, has been diluted by the addition of other items in stores, like clothing, Christmas decorations and a snack bar.  On Friday, Costco returned to its roots with the launch of Costco Business Centre in Scarborough, Ont. the first of what the retailer intends to be several cross-Canada locations catering to small business purchasing needs. The 127,000 square-foot facility has different operating hours than its other stores in order to better serve its targeted customers and offers delivery in a 24 km-radius of the store.  Approximately 80 per cent of the products found in the Business Centre won’t be available in the typical Costco stores.  “We’re essentially going back to our roots, how we started in Canada,” Marc-Andre Bally, vice-president of Costco Wholesale Business Centre at Costco Wholesale Canada, told BNN in an interview. “We hope to attract a lot of restaurants, convenience store owners who, over the years, we weren’t serving very well.”  The store is still open to all Costco members, but will tailor its offerings to the small-business crowd. Unique items include a $999 barrel of olive oil, a $375 wheel of parmesan cheese and a $5,500 hot dog cart.  10 unique finds at Costco Business Centre (#6: barrels of olive oil for $999 each) https://t.co/YjBBQVWZUU pic.twitter.com/qm0aiBPiQx — BusinessNewsNetwork (@BNN) April 1, 2017  The Business Centre model launched in the U.S. about 20 years ago, and there are currently 14 of those stores south of the border.  Costco plans to roll out 10-15 more of the stores across Canada in the next three to five years, Canadian Grocer reports. The impact those stores will have on the wholesale industry could be significant, as Costco operates at significantly lower margins than typical wholesale suppliers, like Sysco Canada and Gordon Food Service.  Story continues  “Costco operates on a 15 per cent margin at retail,” Bruce Winder of Retail Advisors Network told The Financial Post, “If they work on the same gross margin (for the business centre), which I believe they do, that will significantly disrupt the wholesale market, because wholesalers work on a margin of anywhere from 30 to 50 per cent.”  Costco operates 95 stores across Canada, and has 10 million card-carrying members — more members per capita than the United States.

That\'s the vision presented in Pepsi\'s new ad featuring reality TV star Kendall Jenner. The ad was pulled on Wednesday after being met with widespread condemnation, with critics accusing the drinks giant of appropriating a nationwide protest movement following police shootings of African Americans.  ""Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize,"" Pepsi wrote in a statement on Wednesday. ""We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.""  In the ad released Tuesday, Jenner is in the middle of a photo shoot when she happens to notice a protest march making its way down the street.  It\'s not clear what the smiling, attractive demonstrators are upset about, the only clues being their placards reading ""peace"" and ""love"" and ""join the conversation.""  But Jenner decides to join them anyway, beckoned into the throng by a handsome man with a cello. She rips off her blonde wig, wipes away her lipstick and joins the marchers. The beaming, break-dancing protesters are a far cry from the often fractious demonstrations that have broken out across the United States over the past few years.

Jenner fist-bumps one of her recently adopted activists, before grabbing a can of Pepsi from a well-stocked ice-bucket.  Then comes the ad\'s climax — and perhaps the part that has caused most uproar. Jenner reaches the remarkably calm front-line of the protest. She spots an officer, walks up to him and hands him the Pepsi.  He takes a sip, a woman wearing a nose-ring and a traditional Muslim headscarf takes a photograph and everybody cheers.  The ad has sparked accusations that Pepsi has appropriated a racial protest movement to sell a global fizzy drinks brand.  ""This ad trivializes the urgency of the issues and it diminishes the seriousness and the gravity of why we got into the street in the first place,"" activist DeRay McKesson told NBC News correspondent Gabe Gutierrez.  McKesson, who organized and protested in Ferguson after the death of Michael Brown, also takes issue with the brand\'s apology. ""Pepsi didn\'t apologize to all of the people who have been protesting for two years, didn\'t apologize to the people who dedicated their lives and their time to these issues and to understand the urgency of them because in so many cases, there\'s so much at stake including people\'s lives,"" he said.  It drew scathing criticism on social media from Bernice King, the youngest daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. She posted an image of her father mid-peaceful protest — literally being pushed back by a police line and tweeted: ""If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi.""

Jul-19,"[""Apple (AAPL) reported its Q3 2019 earnings on Tuesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's the most important information you need from the report, as well as consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue: $53.8 billion versus $53.4 billion expected.  EPS: $2.18 versus $2.10 expected.  Services revenue: $11.5 billion versus $11.9 billion expected  iPhone revenue: $26 billion versus $26.5 billion  Apple’s stock reached 2019 highs shortly after the announcement.  “This was our biggest June quarter ever — driven by all-time record revenue from services, accelerating growth from wearables, strong performance from iPad and Mac and significant improvement in iPhone trends,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook.  The earnings report comes amid a time of major changes at Apple. In June, Apple design chief Jony Ive announced that he was stepping down from his position at the company to start his own design firm, LoveFrom. He'll still work with Apple, though, as the company will be LoveFrom's first client.  Apple's services revenue is growing, though the iPhone still makes up the bulk of the company's sales. (Image: David Foster)  Apple is also attempting to pivot away from its heavy reliance on iPhone sales as its largest source of revenue to focus more on services. The biggest piece of the company's plan, its Apple TV+ streaming service, is expected to debut later this fall.  Apple also recently announced that it is acquiring Intel's (INTC) modem business to allow it to develop its own 5G modems for upcoming iPhone models.  All of this comes against the backdrop of increased scrutiny of major tech companies like Apple, which are being targeted for potential antitrust violations.  Apple's wearables category now generates more revenue than its iPad business. (Image: Apple)  Apple, one of the world's most valuable companies, has been a frequent target of Big Tech opponents including the likes of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who says that the company, and others like it, should be broken up.  The biggest criticism against Apple is that the company sells its own apps in its App Store, which compete directly with third-party apps listed in the storefront. There's also the matter of the 30% cut Apple takes from the sale of every app purchase from the App Store. Spotify has been particularly vocal in its opposition to Apple's App Store fees.  Story continues  More recently, President Donald Trump’s announcement that the upcoming Mac Pro won’t be given a waiver protecting it from 25% tariffs imposed on Chinese-made goods entering the U.S. Apple, though, is unlikely to bring production of the Pro to the U.S.  More from Dan:  Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

That's because late last week Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced that its Slack competitor, Teams, now has 13 million daily active users and 19 million monthly active users.  In contrast, Slack's daily active user count totals about 10 million, according to a regulatory filing from the end of May. Which means that, even presuming that Slack has continued growing since it last disclosed user figures, Microsoft has become a serious threat.  Microsoft drove that point home by creating a graph showing Teams' growth since its release in 2016, compared to Slack's user growth:  A graph showing the growth of Microsoft Teams daily active users overtaking Slack's.  Image source: Microsoft.  Microsoft's latest announcement should concern Slack and its investors for two key reasons. First, it shows that Microsoft is adept at building valuable cloud-based software that appeals to its customers. And second, it proves that Slack's business has yet to create a sustainable competitive advantage to fend off established tech companies.  Why Slack should be concerned  In response to Microsoft's blog post, Slack CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield said that he's not concerned about Teams' growth. He pointed to the fact that Microsoft has spent billions of dollars on Bing to make it a viable competitor with Google in internet search space. And yet it still only attracts about 9% of the market. Essentially, Butterfield believes that just because Microsoft is a large company with lots of money, it doesn't mean that it can beat his company.  But Slack and its investors shouldn't brush Microsoft's latest report aside. The tech giant has rebuilt itself over the past few years as a leading cloud computing player. In the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft's commercial cloud sales grew 41% year over year, and its popular cloud computing platform, Azure, increased its sales 73% from the year-ago quarter.  Story continues  What does the company's cloud growth have to do with Teams? It's proof that administrators still look to Microsoft for their business software needs, and that means adding Teams into the mix is a logical step for many companies. Enterprise companies looking for a communication tool that's built by one of the most trusted tech companies in the world are turning to Microsoft. The company said back in March that 91 Fortune 100 companies now use Teams.  But the biggest point of concern for Slack investors should be that Teams' rapid growth shows that Slack doesn't yet have a sustainable competitive advantage.  Computer display showing Microsoft Teams communications software.  Image source: Microsoft  Microsoft was able to create a Slack competitor nearly three years after Slack came into existence, and has since become one of its biggest rivals. It doesn't mean that Slack isn't a great tool or that it can't find a way to beat Microsoft, but it does mean that at this point nothing is stopping Microsoft (or other major tech companies) from creating Slack clones and beating the young company at its own game.  Investor takeaway  All of the above doesn't mean that Slack is doomed. But shareholders need to keep a close eye on Microsoft Teams' growth compared to Slack's. The young company may shed some light on its daily active user figure when it reports its second-quarter results, likely in September.  Additionally, investors need to remember that the online communication segment that Slack and Microsoft Teams occupy is still in its infancy. Slack could prove to be a great long-term investment, but it's still too early to tell how well it can compete with Teams.  Bottom line: Investors should be cautious before buying Slack's stock, and current shareholders need to keep a close eye on Microsoft.

Chris Neiger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Microsoft. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy."", 'Microsoft (MSFT 2.33%) late last week impressed investors with solid numbers for its fourth quarter. Its revenue and adjusted earnings rose 12% and 21%, respectively, buoyed by the growth of its commercial cloud business, which grew its revenue 39% annually and accounted for nearly a third of its top line.  However, Microsoft\'s gaming business was a soft spot in the earnings report. It posted a 10% annual decline in revenue and missed its own expectations. Xbox hardware sales plunged 48% annually, while sales of Xbox software and services -- a bright spot in previous quarters -- slid 3%.  Soft demand for Xbox consoles isn\'t surprising since the Xbox One is nearly six years old and gamers anticipate new consoles next year. Soft sales of video games were also expected due to a lack of major game releases during the quarter. However, Microsoft also noted that it faced a ""tough comparable"" from lower sales of an unnamed third-party title.  Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad claimed that title was Epic Games\' Fortnite and that gamers are spending significantly less cash in the free-to-play game. Let\'s see how Fortnite\'s decline is affecting Microsoft, and whether or not it will weigh down its gaming revenue in fiscal 2020.  Are gamers losing interest in Fortnite?  Fortnite launched two years ago and is currently available on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, the PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch. The game has three main modes: a shooter-survival mode, a battle royale mode, and a creative mode for building worlds and battle arenas.  Fortnite generates revenue by selling V-bucks, an in-game currency that can be spent on cosmetic skins, dances, and pre-released game modes for certain characters. It generated $2.4 billion in revenue in 2018 according to SuperData, making it the year\'s highest-grossing free-to-play game with over 200 million players worldwide.  But 2019 was a much tougher year for Fortnite. Revenue fell 48% month-over-month across all platforms in January, according to SuperData. The firm also recently claimed Fortnite generated $203 million in revenue in May, marking a 38% drop from a year earlier.  Newzoo also recently reported that Fortnite continues to lose viewers on Twitch. As a result, Tencent\'s (TCEHY 0.52%) Riot Games, the publisher of League of Legends, overtook Epic (which Tencent also holds a stake in) as the most-watched publisher on Twitch in the second quarter.  Newzoo still ranks Fortnite as the fifth most popular core PC game worldwide, but it clearly peaked as it faced tougher competition from similar games like Electronic Arts\' Apex Legends and Activision Blizzard\'s Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. It also faces fierce competition on mobile devices from games like PUBG Mobile and NetEase\'s Knives Out.  What does Fortnite\'s decline mean for Microsoft?  Microsoft and other platform operators typically retain a cut (usually about 30%) of Fortnite\'s revenue, with a few major exceptions.  Epic avoided paying Alphabet\'s Google that cut by directing Android users to download the app from its website instead of Google Play, and applied the same strategy on Windows and Mac by launching its Epic Games Store last December.  Microsoft still controls its Xbox gaming ecosystem as a walled garden, so it\'s likely still generating a full slice of Fortnite\'s revenue on Xbox consoles. We can\'t quantify the exact value of Fortnite for Microsoft without knowing the exact number of Fortnite gamers on Microsoft, their spending patterns, and its cut of the game\'s revenue -- but its earnings report and Ahmad\'s comments indicate that the game\'s decline was significant enough to dent Microsoft\'s gaming business.  On the bright side, Microsoft noted that it partly offset its weaker software sales with higher sales of Xbox Live and Game Pass subscriptions, which indicates that its gaming ecosystem remains healthy.  The bottom line  We won\'t know how much revenue Microsoft\'s gaming unit generated in 2019 until it files its 10-K report (and it releases it in early August), but it generated 9% of the tech giant\'s revenue in 2018. The gaming business was weak over the past few quarters, but Microsoft easily offset that softness with the growth of its commercial cloud business -- which is firing on all cylinders with the growth of Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365.  Microsoft expects the gaming business to warm up in the second half of fiscal 2020 as it works through the tough year-over-year comparisons. It also has several long-term catalysts on the horizon, including its new Xbox and xCloud cloud gaming service, which could both turn the gaming unit into a roaring growth engine again.']","[""Amazon.com (AMZN 3.54%) and Walmart (WMT 0.90%) dominate the retail market in America and, increasingly, many other areas of the world. As they've risen to power, they've created fortunes for investors along the way.  But which of their stocks is the better buy today?  Competitive strategy  Walmart's more than 11,000 stores in 27 countries serve as not just as the face of the company's traditional retail operations, but also as valuable hubs for e-commerce order fulfillment and delivery. Walmart is investing aggressively to transition into an omnichannel retailer that seamlessly blends its in-store and online operations. And in the U.S., where roughly 90% of the population lives within 10 miles of one of its locations, Walmart's massive store base provides a powerful competitive advantage that other traditional retailers can't match.  Amazon, however, is able to circumvent its lack of stores with a network of distribution centers strategically placed around the world. These high-tech warehouses allow the e-commerce juggernaut to offer one-day shipping on more than 10 million items. So while Walmart's stores provide a high level of convenience for shoppers, Amazon is largely able to offset this with its free-shipping options.  Moreover, while Walmart's retail operations account for nearly the entirety of its revenue, Amazon is a far more diverse business. Amazon Web Services is the world's leading cloud-computing infrastructure service -- one that some analysts believe could be worth a whopping $350 billion by 2022. Amazon also has a fast-growing digital advertising business that's on track to generate $22 billion in annual sales by 2022. These businesses provide sizable profits that Amazon can use to further strengthen and expand its e-commerce operations.  All told, with several powerful businesses fueling its growth, Amazon is in a stronger competitive position than Walmart.  Advantage: Amazon  Financial fortitude  Let's now review how Amazon and Walmart stack up in regards to some key financial metrics.  Metric Amazon Walmart Revenue $241.55 billion $515.64 billion Operating income $14.91 billion $21.75 billion Operating cash flow $34.36 billion $26.16 billion Free cash flow $20.74 billion $15.42 billion Cash and investments $37.02 billion $9.26 billion Debt $23.32 billion $53.72 billion  Walmart generates more than twice as much revenue as Amazon and significantly more operating profits. Amazon, however, produced greater operating and free cash flow over the past year. Given the online juggernaut also has a stronger balance sheet -- with nearly $14 billion in net cash versus $44 billion in net debt for Walmart -- Amazon has the edge here.  Advantage: Amazon  Growth  When it comes to growth, this better buy battle is particularly one-sided. Amazon's revenue and operating profits have expanded at vastly superior rates than those of Walmart in recent years.  Wall Street expects these trends to continue. Amazon's revenue is projected to increase roughly 18% in both 2019 and 2020. Its earnings per share, meanwhile, are expected to rise an even more impressive 33% annually over the next five years, fueled by the strong growth of AWS and Amazon's digital ads business.  Walmart, however, is forecast to grow its sales by only about 3% annually over the next two years. Moreover, its earnings are expected to increase by less than 5% annually over the next five years, with its investments in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart likely to weigh on its results during this time.  Clearly, Amazon has a significant advantage in terms of expected revenue and profit growth in the coming years.  Advantage: Amazon  Price  Lastly, let's see how these retail titans compare in regards to some common stock valuation metrics.  Metric Amazon Walmart Price-to-sales ratio 4.11 0.63 Price-to-free-cash-flow ratio 47.89 20.99 Trailing price-to-earnings ratio 84.22 39.53 Forward price-to-earnings ratio 52.74 22.37  Walmart's stock is less expensive based on sales, cash flow, trailing earnings, and analysts' forward earnings estimates. This is to be somewhat expected, given Amazon's superior growth rates. Still, Walmart's shares are clearly priced lower than Amazon's.  Advantage: Walmart  The better buy is...  Walmart's stock may be cheaper, but Amazon's diversified revenue streams, stronger balance sheet, and greater growth prospects make it a better long-term investment."", ""Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a tremendous investment over the years. Over just the last five years, shares of the e-commerce titan have gained a whopping 476% (through July 5) -- more than seven times the S&P 500's 67% return.  While this is great for investors who have owned the stock for some time, the key thing investors want to know now is where Amazon will likely be in the future -- let's say five years from now.  Not even famed seer Nostradamus could predict the future with complete accuracy. However, we can use what we know about Amazon's business model to make an educated forecast about what its future will look like in the year 2024.  Hand holding a crystal ball in front of a body of water and sunset or sunrise.  Image source: Getty Images.  Jeff Bezos will still be running the show  Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos turned 55 earlier this year. If we fast-forward to 2024, it seems more likely than not that a 60-year-old Bezos will still be leading the company. Investors should hope that's the case, as he'll be very difficult to replace.  Amazon's global e-commerce empire will be mightier  E-commerce's current approximately 10% share of U.S. retail sales will continue to increase, with a similar dynamic occurring in international markets. Amazon will continue to be the prime (pun intended) beneficiary of the growing size of the sector pie. Not only do many people love the convenience of shopping online, but they specifically love Amazon, thanks largely to its massive selection and loyalty program, Prime. In fact, Amazon captured nearly 50% of all e-commerce sales in the United States in 2018. That means it had a roughly 5% share of total U.S. retail sales last year.  Chart showing e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales in the U.S. from the first quarter of 2000 (0.8%) to the first quarter of 2019 (10.2%).  Image source: Statista.  Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be much bigger  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the dominant player in the fast-growing cloud computing service market. In 2018, it had a 32% market share of this $80 billion global market, which grew 46% year over year, according to market research firm Canalys.  Story continues  The cloud service space is widely expected to continue to grow rapidly, and there's every reason to believe that AWS will still be the market leader in 2024. If this proves the case, Amazon's operating income should continue its upward climb. In the first quarter, the ultra-profitable AWS generated just 13% of the company's overall revenue, but 50% of its total operating income.  Amazon will be disrupting the U.S. pharmacy market  In 2024, Amazon should be well on its way to disrupting the approximately $400 billion U.S. pharmacy market. Last year, the company bought online pharmacy PillPack, giving it the ability to speedily deliver prescription drugs across the country.  It will enter the U.S. marijuana market as soon as federal legalization occurs  I can't predict when marijuana will be legal on a federal level in the U.S., but once it is, look for Amazon to enter the market. Its initial move will probably be carrying cannabis products at its Whole Foods stores and making select ones available for free two-hour delivery via its Prime Now service.  Amazon is doing just this with alcohol -- beer, wine, and (in some cases) spirits -- in select cities. So, it has procedures in place to deliver regulated products.  It will be using or on the cusp of using self-driving vehicles  In 2024, fully autonomous vehicles should be legal across the U.S. or at least fast approaching receiving the federal green light. Look for Amazon to be an early adopter of driverless vehicles for at least some portions of its delivery operations. It might also be using drones -- or on the verge of doing so -- for some deliveries from its fulfillment centers to customers.  An Amazonian list of ways to grow  Amazon's other existing businesses, including its advertising and Alexa-powered smart-home businesses, should also be notably larger in five years. The company will also continue to expand into entirely new businesses.  What about Amazon's stock price?  Nobody can predict with any degree of accuracy the stock price of any company five years out. There are too many variables, including the states of the stock market and the economy. However, if you invest in the right companies, stock prices should take care of themselves over the long haul.  For whatever it's worth, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow earnings at a torrid average annual pace of 94% over the next five years.

The cards are set to launch this Sunday, and are designed to directly compete with NVIDIA\'s $349 RTX 2060 and $399 RTX Super GPUs.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Roku  top stock trades for ROKU    Click to Enlarge  Shares of Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) ripped higher on Friday, climbing about 5% on the day. The stock has quickly raced higher by more than $10 from its lows earlier this week.  Roku made a perfect test and reversal off its 50-day moving average (on an analyst downgrade, no less) on Tuesday and is pushing through its 20-day moving average on Friday.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  What now?  If ROKU can penetrate $100, its $108.32 high is on the table. Its momentum via the MACD measure (blue circle) isn’t in bulls’ favor yet, but could be soon.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Electronic Arts  top stock trades for EA    Click to Enlarge  Shares of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) made a really negative development this week.  On the plus side, the stock held up at long-term range support near $90. On the downside though, range resistance at $105 is still in place, while EA also fell through its 10-week, 50-week and 200-week moving average during the week.  Until proven wrong, though, bulls can buy on dips down toward $90 and sell on rallies up to $105. A breakout or breakdown from either level would negate that setup.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Alphabet  top stock trades for GOOGL    Click to Enlarge  It has been a very strong four trading sessions for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). First, shares gapped up from ~$1,080 to the notable $1,100 level.  Just a few sessions later, we have the stock pushing through both the 200-day and 50-day moving averages and hitting its highest level since May. Now what?  It’s possible shares go on a run ahead of earnings later this month. But I want to see how GOOGL stock does early next week near this 200-day and 50-day moving average. They are just a few dollars apart and it’s possible GOOGL reverses next week. Should the rally continue, the $1,180 to $1,200 area is on the table. On a pullback, I want to see the ~$1,100 area hold up as support.  Story continues  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Zscaler  top stock trades for ZS    Click to Enlarge  We tried Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) on the long side about a month ago, but the stock wasn’t ready to run even though it was flirting with a breakout over $80. Even though the breakout failed, the uptrend held steady (blue line), as ZS continued to put in a series of higher lows.  Then, we had the best price action in ZS on Friday.  After logging its highest closing price on Wednesday — over the $80 breakout level — shares pulled back early on Friday before bouncing off $80 and going on to new highs. It’s very constructive to see former resistance turn into support. I would love to see a continuation higher next week. Otherwise, tests of $80 that hold as support may be solid buying opportunities.  Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

More From InvestorPlace  The post 4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: ROKU, EA, GOOGL appeared first on InvestorPlace.', 'Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google gets lots of attention for its artificial intelligence (AI) pursuits, mainly because the company is so good at applying AI to a variety of businesses. Consider that Google\'s core advertising business uses AI to determine which ads to serve online users, and the company\'s AI assistant, Google Assistant, is one of the best voice-search services available. Or that Waymo, formerly Google\'s self-driving car project, has driven 11 billion autonomous miles on public roads and even has its own commercial autonomous-vehicle ride-hailing service.  But aside from Google\'s impressive AI moves, plenty of other players are applying AI to key parts of their businesses, and should benefit from what is projected to be a $15.7 trillion market by 2030. If you\'re in the market for an AI stock that isn\'t Alphabet, then check out Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).  Digital image of a brain on a grey background.  Microsoft  The tech giant is one of the biggest cloud computing companies in the world right now, but it also has its sights set on AI. At the beginning of 2018, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that ""AI is the run-time which is going to shape all of what we do.""  One of the most important ways Microsoft is benefiting from AI is through its cloud computing business. That\'s because the lines between AI and cloud computing are beginning to blur. The cloud computing market is expanding as developers and companies look to automate more of their software and find more efficient ways to collect data.  Microsoft is the No. 2 public cloud computing company, behind Amazon, which means that as AI grows, Microsoft\'s business is likely to grow right along with it. The company has already integrated many AI services into its Azure cloud computing platform, including object recognition and speech translation.  AI integration with Azure is important to note because Microsoft\'s Azure revenue jumped 73% in the most recent quarter, and the broader cloud computing market will be worth $278 billion by 2021.  Story continues  Baidu  It can be easy to assume that most AI companies worth investing in are based in the U.S. But investors shouldn\'t overlook what some China-based companies, specifically Baidu, are accomplishing.  Baidu uses AI to improve its massive online search tool, but it\'s also using AI to make self-driving cars a reality. The company\'s autonomous-vehicle project, Apollo, is an open-source software platform that Baidu says will help put self-driving cars on China\'s roads by 2021.  While fully self-driving cars are still years away, Baidu has already conducted autonomous-vehicle tests in the U.S. and China, driving more than 1 million autonomous miles across 13 Chinese cities. Baidu also recently partnered with Toyota to bring Apollo to some of the automaker\'s future autonomous buses, and to research self-driving vehicles together.  Why is self-driving so important to Baidu? First, because China is the largest automotive market in the world, so whatever happens there in transportation is a big deal. Second, the Chinese driverless-car market is poised to become a $500 billion industry about a decade from now.  Amazon  Last but certainly not least is Amazon, which has a growing list of ways to benefit from AI. First, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in an investor letter two years ago that machine learning, a type of AI, directs everything from product demand forecasting to product search ranks and deal recommendations on its website. What this means is that Amazon sees AI as an integral part of operating nearly every part of its e-commerce business.  Second, the company is benefiting from AI the same way that Microsoft is, through cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the dominant cloud computing platform and has been continually integrating AI services. Developers can, for example, use facial recognition, speech translation, and a host of other AI services through AWS. AI\'s integration is important for Amazon because right now, AWS is the company\'s biggest profit generator.  Third, Amazon has been integrating its Alexa smart assistant into a plethora of devices and services over the past few years and making strategic partnerships to bring Alexa to third-party devices. These moves have helped the company become one of the leaders in the connected-home market, allowing it to use AI to learn even more about the things its customers buy and when they buy them.  Investor takeaway  AI services will slowly take over industries and affect many businesses -- so if you\'re looking to benefit from this growing trend, there\'s no shortage of companies betting on it. The important thing to remember is that artificial intelligence may not always take the shape of digital assistants and self-driving cars.  If you look at how companies like Microsoft, Baidu, and Amazon are integrating AI to boost their businesses, you\'ll see that the growing AI market is more than just hype.

The company\'s strong showing was widely expected, and followed last quarter\'s disappointing quarterly results that have fanned analyst fears of demand concerns.  Tesla said it produced a record 87,048 vehicles during the second quarter and delivered around 95,200 vehicles, also a record. Deliveries topped the 87,749 vehicles analysts polled by Bloomberg expected.  ""We believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3,"" the company said.  Advertisement  Tesla said it delivered 77,550 Model 3 vehicles in the second quarter, topping analysts\' expectations for 70,959 deliveries, per Bloomberg data. The automaker noted it was entering the third quarter with an increase in its order backlog, seeking to quell investors\' concerns over demand.

Now it\'s dumped most of what was left.  A vocal Tesla bull says he can no longer \'look investors in the eye\' and recommend the stock  Advertisement  Workers at Tesla\'s Buffalo solar tile factory say the company sabotaged their efforts to find new jobs after trying to unionize', 'Tesla shares suffered their steepest drop of the year after the electric car maker reported a wider-than-expected loss and disappointing revenue and announced the departure of co-founder and Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel from the executive ranks.  The stock plunged 13.6% to $228.82 at the close. That\'s the biggest decline since the shares fell 13.9% on Sept. 28, 2018. At times on Thursday, the stock was down more than 14%, which would\'ve been the steepest drop since 2013.  The company says it has a weekly run-rate of 7,000 of its most popular Model 3 vehicles, and aims to be able to produce 10,000 Model 3s weekly by the end of 2019. But costs related to sales and servicing are also way up, weighing on profitability. Gross margin, or the money left from sales after subtracting costs of goods sold, fell to 14.5% from 15.5% a year ago.  ""For the bulls this is a disaster story in terms of gross margin,"" said Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, on CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell"" on Wednesday. ""You can sell more cars — can you do it profitably? If not, ultimately this company will have to raise more capital next year. That\'s why it\'s such an issue for the Street.""  During the call with analysts after the report, CEO Elon Musk dropped another bombshell when he announced that Straubel was moving from CTO to an advisory role. Straubel is best known for helping to create Tesla\'s signature battery technology. He also oversaw power electronics, motors, software, firmware and controls, among other responsibilities during his tenure.  Straubel, who will be succeeded by Drew Baglino, a vice president at the company, is the latest high-profile departure from Tesla\'s executive ranks as brain drain continues to be another big concern for investors. Steve McManus, who was a vice president in charge of engineering for car interiors and exteriors at Tesla, recently joined Apple , which also lured former Tesla vice president Michael Schwekutsch to join its Special Projects Group earlier this year. In June, the company lost Peter Hochholdinger, who ran manufacturing at the factory in Fremont, California, to Lucid Motors.  In the second quarter, Tesla lost $1.12 per share on an adjusted basis, compared to the average analyst estimate of 40 cents, according to Refinitiv. Revenue climbed 59% to $6.35 billion, but trailed the $6.41 billion average analyst estimate.  Although the company fell short of expectations, it reaffirmed full-year delivery guidance, saying it still expects to sell 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year, mostly Model 3s. Tesla delivered around 158,200 of its cars to customers in the first six months of 2019 and has to deliver more than 200,000 in the back half of the year to hit the low-end of its guidance.', '[Editor’s note: “7 Battery Stocks for High-Powered Gains” was previously published in May 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]  One of the underperforming sectors in the stock market today is the battery sector. Trade tensions, higher raw material costs and global inflation are just a few of the macroeconomic headwinds that consumer discretionary stocks face. Yet stock markets tend to over-exaggerate on the downside risks, punishing a sector on the view that things will not improve.  Fundamentally, the battery market is undergoing a major shift. Electric vehicles are driving the demand for lithium-ion batteries. Solar power panel prices plunged in recent years. This is creating a potentially higher demand for battery solutions to store energy captured from such panels.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  How might investors play the battery boom led by growing electric vehicle production and a soaring number of devices needing portable power?  Battery Stocks to Buy: Tesla (TSLA)  Battery Stocks to Buy: Tesla (TSLA)  Source: Shutterstock  Let us start with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The stock has fallen by nearly 25% this year because its unit sales of EVs are under pressure. With government subsidies no longer supporting them as much, Tesla shares are underperforming.  Still, the company’s ambition extends beyond electric cars. On May 16, Tesla completed its acquisition of Maxwell. At a cost of just $200 million, it gains some valuable intellectual property. Maxwell is best known for its manufacturing of ultracapacitors, but it is also developing dry electrode technology for batteries.  If Maxwell’s R&D efforts pay off, the unit could bring performance enhancements for lithium-ion battery cells. For starters, Tesla could start manufacturing batteries that have an energy density of over 500Wh/kg. That would bring a 15% to 100% increase to Tesla’s current battery technology.  Story continues  Informally, Tesla has the best battery technology in the auto industry. Adding Maxwell’s IP may also result in lithium-ion batteries that gain in capacity and will not lose energy after charged. Ultimately, TSLA stock could start turning around once the company implements the new technology. Having battery technology that is even further ahead of that offered by other automobile manufacturers could drive Tesla EV sales.  Tesla is facing a slowdown in sales of Model S and Model 3. It has a cross-over Model Y that is not yet on the market. Chances are good that both the Model Y release and new battery technology coming with it will give the stock a boost.  Energizer Holdings (ENR)  Battery Stocks to Buy Now: Energizer Holdings (ENR)  Source: Shutterstock  Shares of Energizer Holdings (NYSE:ENR) are stuck in a narrow trading range of between $37.50 and $40,50. Known best for its Energizer bunny rabbit on television commercials, the company is more than just a battery company. It has ambitions for transforming into a diversified global household products leader. This change brings along with it high goals. Energizer aims to grow adjusted free cash flow to $330 million-$370 million in 2020.  There are three goals:  1. Generating adjusted EBITDA of $650 million-$675 million.  2. Driving organic sales growth through pricing, innovation, and distribution gains.  3. Deleveraging its balance sheet to a net leverage ratio of 4 times.  Energizer bolstered its battery business by completing its acquisition of Battery and Auto Care. In doing so, the company will establish itself as a global leader while adding brands to diversify its business. It expanded its manufacturing facilities. Plus, over the past five years, it optimized its legacy factories to improve on cost and efficiency.  In its second quarter, Energizer took advantage of strong demand for its legacy batteries by raising prices. Energizer MAX and Energizer lithium product prices rose in the U.S. The company expects to complete the price hike in international markets by the end of the fiscal year.  ENR shares trade at 12 times forward P/E. With its consumer battery business strong and auto battery entry underway, the stock has the potential to break out of the trading range.  Enphase Energy (ENPH)  Battery Stocks to Buy: Enphase Energy (ENPH)  Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) surged to a new 52-week high after the company reported a strong first quarter. Revenue rose 43%, while the company issued a second-quarter revenue outlook. It now expects revenue in the range of $115 million-$125 million. This is above the $96 million analysts had expected.  Enphase makes microinverters, which the company says “offer the most advanced inverter technology on the market, which means higher production, greater reliability, and unmatched intelligence.” In the first quarter, Enphase shipped 976,410 microinverters. The company now has 2,500 homeowners that joined its Enphase Upgrade Program. In doing so, these customers get quality and service. And strong customer satisfaction is leading to more business.  Enphase still grew revenue in the quarter despite facing component shortages in all of its regions. This implies that once the supply issues are resolved, revenue should grow at an even faster pace. Looking ahead, Enphase expects to have a capacity of 2 million microconverters by the fourth quarter of 2019. The higher supply will also cut its microinverter lead times to around 6-8 weeks.  Enphase will expand its IQ7 microinverter regionally. Adding high-power and high-performance products, adding AC modules, and bringing Ensemble Solar and Storage technology will further drive revenue.  ENPH stock is near a 52-week high but may continue climbing higher following that strong earnings report.  Panasonic Corporation (PCRFY)  Battery Stocks to Buy Now: Panasonic Corporation (PCRFY)  Source: Panasonic  Panasonic Corporation (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) fell to yearly lows on no recent bad news. On May 9, the company announced that it would team up with Toyota (NYSE: TM) to make smart homes. Panasonic is already an existing partner in supplying batteries for Toyota’s electric vehicles. So with tens of thousands of homes potentially implementing a smart home, the partnership is a natural extension.  Panasonic specializes in batteries and home appliances, while Toyota started developing robots that help with household jobs.  In January, the two firms formed a joint venture for the manufacture of EV batteries. Toyota will own 51% of the venture while Panasonic will own the remaining 49%. The companies aim to increase battery capacity by 50 times, compared to those used in current Toyota hybrid vehicles. Mazda, Subaru and Daihatsu will source batteries from this joint venture. Honda already uses Panasonic batteries but will benefit from this new collaboration.  Panasonic and Toyota will also develop solid-state batteries, which will eventually replace the lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars today. By offering a higher range at a lower cost, these new battery types could drive Panasonic’s revenues higher.  Johnson Controls (JCI)  Battery Stocks to Buy: Johnson Controls (JCI)  Source: Shutterstock  Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) is the largest manufacturer of automotive batteries. The company consolidated its business in the second quarter when it closed the sale of Power Solutions ahead of schedule. Brookfield Business Partners closed its $13.2 billion acquisition of the battery unit on Apr. 30.  With the battery unit sold, why should investors consider JCI stock? With growth prospects in other markets, investors could get some diversification away from battery suppliers. JCI’s underlying fundamentals are strong and the company enjoys an $8.8 billion backlog. This gives it clear visibility into 2020.  In the second quarter, JCI’s adjusted sales grew 3% year-on-year as EPS grew 23% to 32 cents. The $5.8 billion in revenue from the Buildings unit is another bonus for holding the stock. Though JCI sold its battery unit, it still has institutional knowledge around the energy storage solutions market. For example, HVAC and controls rose in the mid-single digits while the fire and security unit is up in the mid-single-digit growth rate.  For fiscal 2019, JCI expects adjusted free cash flow conversion topping 95%.  On the balance sheet, JCI ended Q2 with $12.15 billion in debt. The sale of Power Solutions allows the company to cut debt by $3.4 billion. It has $8.2 billion to buyback shares. By investing back into the company, Johnson Controls’ stock could trade at new highs in the coming months.  Albemarle (ALB)  Stocks to Buy: Albemarle (ALB)  Source: fdecomite via Flickr (Modified)  In the specialty chemicals space, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), which forecast revenue rising 8%-14% this year, benefited from lithium prices rising 3% from last year. The company reported revenue of $832 million and adjusted EBITDA of $226 million. Still, the company’s EPS fell 5% year-on-year to $1.23.  Albemarle noted on its conference call that global sales of electric vehicles rose by almost 60%. This led to battery production rising. The company generated sales of $292 million for lithium. Thanks to a long-term agreement structure, pricing rose 3%.  For the full-year 2019, Albemarle expands sustained, strong demand for lithium. And although excess lithium carbonate from China hurt prices for carbonate, Albemarle will not compete in the same markets until pricing improves. Overall, management expects production growth of 15,000 to 20,000 metric tons and EBITDA growing in the high teens. With the company committed to 40% margins and existing long-term contracts in place, ALB stock should not stay at yearly lows for too long.  Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM)  Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM)  Source: Shutterstock  Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) is another lithium supplier. In April, it raised its lithium outlook and said it expected sales of around 50,000 tons. The higher output is due to its operations in the Atacama salt flat.  SQM shares aren’t far from their 52-week lows largely because of the company’s disappointing first-quarter earnings report. . In Q1, the company’s top and bottom lines came in meaningfully below analysts’ average estimates.  Investors are not confident that the company will meet the demand growth led by full electric vehicle penetration levels reaching ~2%. Still, if SQM can increase its total capacity this year and next, the company may eventually achieve its 180,000 metric ton output target. In the near-term, SQM will keep producing at levels about demand, accumulating inventory. In doing so, it will have more flexibility in selling in higher volume if prices and demand levels are favorable.  For the rest of 2019, SQM expects pricing levels similar to last year’s levels. Strategically, the company will not go after market share in the short-term. Instead, it expects demand in 2025 will top one million metric tons. From there, it is positioning the company to have the output capabilities to meet that demand level.  As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) has navigated those turbulent waters well, and despite ongoing efforts to make changes to the way that federal and state government provide health insurance to those who don\'t have access to it at work, UnitedHealth has been able to find pathways toward faster growth.  Coming into Thursday\'s second-quarter financial report, UnitedHealth investors hoped that the company would be able to keep up its momentum and deliver solid results for the period. UnitedHealth\'s report showed that the company remains on track, and its Optum unit was particularly successful in helping to boost revenue and profit for the overall business.  How UnitedHealth kept growing  UnitedHealth\'s second-quarter results featured good performance across the board. Revenue rose 8% to $60.6 billion, essentially matching what most of those following the stock had expected to see from the healthcare giant. Net income climbed almost 13% to $3.29 billion, and after accounting for some extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share came in well ahead of the consensus forecast among investors for $3.45 per share.  OptumCare logo of stylized 3-d square in yellow, orange, and gray.  Image source: UnitedHealth Group.  From a segment perspective, UnitedHealth got good contributions from both sides of its business. In the UnitedHealthcare division, revenue climbed 6%, leading to a 12% rise in operating earnings for the unit. Sales growth was strongest in the Medicare and retirement area, which featured double-digit percentage gains due largely to increased interest in Medicare Advantage products. More modest increases in the community and state and employer & individual areas also added to revenue gains, although membership trends were mixed across those two areas as UnitedHealth made choices that led to reduced membership counts among state government customers. The insurer\'s global business saw flat revenue year over year. Overall, the company served more than 700,000 additional members during the period that it did 12 months ago.  Story continues  Meanwhile, the Optum health services business saw even stronger growth, with overall segment revenue gains exceeding 13% and giving investors a 14% rise in operating profit. The OptumHealth wellness and health management division saw the largest gains of 20% on the top line, as UnitedHealth worked hard to get more revenue on a per-customer basis from its existing client list. The OptumRx prescription benefit manager featured sales gains of nearly 12%, while the OptumInsight data analytics division enjoyed a 7% rise in revenue and a 20% backlog boost.  What\'s next for UnitedHealth?  CEO David Wichmann was succinct in his comments about the company. ""Our results in the quarter,"" Wichmann said, ""reflect strong and balanced performance from both Optum and UnitedHealthcare."" The CEO once again attributed most of the gains to UnitedHealth\'s workforce, which now number 320,000.  In response to the strong start to the year, UnitedHealth increased its guidance for 2019. The company now sees full-year earnings coming in between $14.70 and $14.90 per share on an adjusted basis, up between $0.20 and $0.30 per share from its previous outlook.  The big question ahead is whether healthcare reform will have a major impact on UnitedHealth\'s business. The company got a nice boost earlier this month when the Trump administration decided to pull back on its proposal to change the way that prescription drug manufacturers offer rebates to pharmacy benefit managers. With that stream of revenue now no longer facing an imminent reform threat, UnitedHealth should be able to use its strong position in the industry to keep generating additional profit.  UnitedHealth investors seemed pleased with the report, and the stock was higher by about 1% in pre-market trading following the announcement. Even though the healthcare industry is changing constantly, UnitedHealth has demonstrated its ability to roll with the punches, and shareholders are confident that the health insurance giant will keep delivering long-term growth in its fundamental business.

The goal of this article is to teach you how to use price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we'll show how Exxon Mobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is Exxon Mobil's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 17.61. That means that at current prices, buyers pay $17.61 for every $1 in trailing yearly profits.  Check out our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil  How Do You Calculate Exxon Mobil's P/E Ratio?  The formula for price to earnings is:  Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)  Or for Exxon Mobil:  P/E of 17.61 = $76.44 ÷ $4.34 (Based on the year to March 2019.)  Is A High P/E Ratio Good?  The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.  How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios  P/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.  Exxon Mobil's earnings per share fell by 8.9% in the last twelve months. But over the longer term (3 years), earnings per share have increased by 12%. And over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have decreased 10.0% annually. So we might expect a relatively low P/E.  How Does Exxon Mobil's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?  The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. As you can see below, Exxon Mobil has a higher P/E than the average company (13.5) in the oil and gas industry.  NYSE:XOM Price Estimation Relative to Market, July 4th 2019  Its relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Exxon Mobil shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.  Story continues  Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank Deposits  The 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.  Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.  So What Does Exxon Mobil's Balance Sheet Tell Us?  Net debt totals 11% of Exxon Mobil's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.  The Bottom Line On Exxon Mobil's P/E Ratio  Exxon Mobil trades on a P/E ratio of 17.6, which is fairly close to the US market average of 18.2. With modest debt, and a lack of recent growth, it would seem the market is expecting improvement in earnings.  Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.  But note: Exxon Mobil may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20).

Companies can and do cut their dividends -- even companies that have increased their dividends for decades on end -- and picking investments based solely on yield can be a recipe for disaster.  What is a dividend?  A dividend is a way for a company to return cash to investors, rewarding them for owning shares. A steadily increasing dividend is a clear sign that a company is successfully growing its business -- the type of company income investors would most like to own. Dividend increases signal to investors that management believes the company\'s future is bright. And management teams generally don\'t want to cut dividends, so they try not to push them up to unsustainable levels. But that doesn\'t mean dividends never get cut.  They do.  And when they do get cut, investors are not happy. They\'re losing the payout and getting an indication that the business is struggling. Investors need to keep their eyes open when it comes to dividends and look for companies that balance a high yield with the ability to support the payout (and hopefully grow it over time).  There\'s no guaranteed way to protect yourself from a dividend cut, but there are signs you can look for to figure out if a dividend is at risk. Here are three clues you should pay close attention to.  1. Payout ratios  The most commonly examined ratio to assess dividend strength is the payout ratio, which compares dividends to earnings. It\'s a pretty good start, since a company that\'s paying more in dividends than it earns is theoretically not capable of supporting its payout.  The term ""theoretically"" here is important, however, because dividends don\'t actually get paid out of earnings. They are paid from cash flow.  For example, real estate investment trusts (REITs) often pay dividends that exceed their earnings because of non-cash depreciation charges. The REIT structure is specifically designed to own physical buildings, which are subject to large depreciation expenses. Depreciation reduces the value of an asset by a little each year to account for wear and tear (and eventual obsolescence, in some cases), and those costs pass through the income statement. But that reduction is really an accounting tool -- nobody is physically taking that money from the company. So while REITs have huge depreciation expenses, those costs don\'t impact the cash they generate.  The chart above for Realty Income (O 0.31%), a bellwether REIT with a 27-year history of annual dividend increases, shows the difference here. This is an extreme example, but it is applicable to all companies.  That doesn\'t mean the payout ratio is meaningless -- in fact, it is an important warning sign that trouble could be brewing. But it shouldn\'t be the only thing you examine. You also need to examine the cash dividend payout ratio, which looks at dividends relative to cash flow. A high ratio on either of these metrics -- or both -- should put dividend investors on edge. Anything approaching 100% should be particularly worrying.  2. Balance sheet  Payout ratio and cash dividend payout ratio, however, aren\'t the only issues to consider when assessing dividend safety. They are just a way to see if a company is having an easy or hard time covering the cost of its dividend. Yes, that alone could lead to a cut, but a cut is more likely to happen if there are other factors at play. One key place to look for weakness is the balance sheet, the financial foundation on which companies are built.  Take ExxonMobil (XOM -0.17%) and Eni (E -0.78%), for example, two of the world\'s largest integrated energy companies. Exxon has a long history of being fiscally conservative, while Eni has a history of being more aggressive with its balance sheet. The chart below compares the debt to equity ratios, a measure of how much debt a company uses, and tells the story pretty well. But here\'s the thing: Volatile energy prices are often the driving force behind these businesses.  When oil prices plummet like they did in mid-2014 (notice the red line on the graph), Exxon can rely on its balance sheet to help support its business and dividend while its earnings are weak (and it isn\'t capable of covering the dividend). In fact, the oil giant\'s debt to equity ratio increased a bit during that tough patch, but it didn\'t come anywhere near a concerning level. Exxon kept increasing its dividend each and every year, a feat that few of its closest peers were able to achieve. Eni had much less leeway because it was already heavily leveraged, which helps explain why the 2014 oil drop led to a dividend cut. When faced with difficult market conditions, heavily leveraged companies may have no choice but to cut their dividends so they can apply cash to other purposes.  That, in fact, is often the best choice for a company, even if it is a disaster for shareholders who have come to rely on its dividend. For example, in 2016 Kinder Morgan (KMI -1.29%) had to choose between its dividend and funding growth projects. The midstream company tends to make more aggressive use of leverage than many of its peers (see the debt to EBITDA ratios in the chart below), and tapping the capital markets at that point in time would have been expensive. So management trimmed the dividend by a massive 75%. That allowed it to get through a tough patch, and it is now back to hiking its dividend again.  Here\'s the thing: Kinder Morgan had a long history of regular dividend increases behind it. And management was actually telling investors to expect a dividend increase of as much as 10% in 2016, just a couple months before the cut was announced. If you just looked at history here (and listened to management), you\'d have been blindsided. If you also considered the company\'s lofty leverage metrics, you\'d have been justifiably concerned, and perhaps would have avoided the company. Note, too, that Kinder Morgan\'s cash dividend payout ratio was above 100% in 2015 and 2016, showing the value of layering these tools atop one another.  3. Interest expenses  The strength of a company\'s balance sheet is an important indicator, but you\'ll also want to look at how well it can handle the debt it has taken on. For this you should look at times interest earned, which compares interest expenses to income. The higher the number the better, since it means interest expenses are better covered. Kinder Morgan\'s times interest earned was 3 in 2014 before it fell to less than 1.5 in 2016 -- a far more worrying figure. Each company is different, but you\'ll want to look for changes and consider what the change really indicates. For Kinder Morgan it was yet another sign that market conditions were causing serious financial stress.  But how about General Mills (GIS -0.94%), where the times interest earned figure has fallen from over 8 to around 5? That decline came about because of a massive increase in debt. The chart below looks pretty concerning, until you think through the situation a little: The debt was used to buy Blue Buffalo, an industry-leading healthy pet food maker that is expected to help General Mills grow its business. And just as important, covering interest expenses 5 times is still pretty solid. Moreover, the company has specifically stated that debt reduction is a key goal. In fact, it plans to hold the dividend steady for a few years while it focuses on that goal.  Now, when a company that has a long streak of annual dividend increases behind it suddenly holds the dividend steady you need to stop and take a look at what\'s going on. (This is a good fourth signal to look at, by the way.) But in this case, General Mills has been open about what it is doing and is working from a position of financial strength, as it can still easily cover its interest expenses. No particular need to worry, though you should be watching the Blue Buffalo integration process closely.  General Mills tends to make heavy use of leverage overall, but because of its business model (selling lots of small ""necessity"" food products to lots of end customers) it has been able to carry the weight of that debt relatively easily, as indicated by times interest earned.  More tools for your tool box  Now for the bad news: There is no sure-fire way to figure out what a company is going to do with its dividend. That decision is up to the board of directors. All you can do is pay close attention and use the information that is available to you to give yourself a feel for how much risk you are facing on the dividend front. Ideally, you should simply avoid situations where the dividend doesn\'t look particularly secure.  A high payout ratio (relative to earnings and cash flow), a heavy debt load, and weak interest coverage are all prime indicators of elevated risk. As you check more and more of these off, your risk of a dividend cut gets higher and higher. While all income investors are tempted by high yields, if a lofty yield comes with too much risk it probably isn\'t worth buying the stock. These tools can help you make that call.', ""Payday is awesome, but a payday you didn't have to work for is even better. Yielding a sweet 4.6% a year, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is a great way to get paid for owning a slice of the oil giant. Whether the stock is for generating income or offsetting stock market volatility, Exxon is a top pick.  But it's not the only one of its kind. Three of our Foolish contributors think that Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX), AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), and Ford (NYSE: F) are good dividend picks, too -- and all of them yield even more than Exxon does at current share prices.  A row of oil pipelines with the sun setting in the distance.  Image source: Getty Images.  Pick up this cyclical stock while it's cheap  Anders Bylund (Seagate Technology): This maker of traditional, spinning-magnetic-disc hard drives isn't a slam-dunk winner for equally traditional income investors. But at today's prices, Seagate's dividends do look juicy and the stock offers plenty of turnaround promise.  The key to finding value in Seagate's business and stock lies in appreciating the cyclical nature of the company's target markets. Sales of both enterprise servers and consumer-level computers have been lagging over the last couple of years as President Trump's trade conflict with China added higher production costs to a natural multiyear downturn.  Seagate investors have suffered a 20% loss in five years while the S&P 500 raced 50% higher. Over the last year alone, Seagate took an 18% haircut while the broader market marched 9% higher. Seagate hasn't raised its quarterly dividends since 2015, but a steady payout divided by a falling stock price equals rising dividend yields. Today, Seagate's yield stands at a meaty 5.3%.  Looking ahead, Seagate's $1.4 billion of trailing free cash flows leave the company ample room to start raising its dividend payouts again. The dividend policy currently consumes just 44% of the company's incoming cash profits. When the China-U.S. trade tensions finally go away, Seagate stands to profit as the PC and server markets start to make up for lost time.  Story continues  Investing in cyclical stocks near their rock-bottom business troughs delivers the one-two punch of low buy-in prices and generous effective dividend yields. That's what you get when buying Seagate right now. It's not a perfect dividend payer and far from a risk-free bet, but Seagate's risk-reward equation looks promising at these prices.  A beaten-up bargain dividend stock  Todd Campbell (AbbVie): A high dividend yield can occur when a company's dividend increases faster than its stock price or when a stock price falls despite a stable dividend payout. In AbbVie's case, it's the latter. The company's shares have been clobbered following news it's acquiring Botox maker Allergan (NYSE: AGN) for $63 billion.  The slide in AbbVie's share price reflects investors' concerns that combining with the debt-laden Allergan won't solve AbbVie's problem -- namely, replacing the revenue that's likely to be lost when generics start competing against Humira in 2023. AbbVie currently generates about 60% of its revenue from Humira, so a drop in Humira sales because of generics could present a stiff headwind to revenue growth in a few years.  I don't think buying Allergan will allow AbbVie to sidestep decelerating growth rates in the future, but income investors might not want to overreact by selling. In fact, if dividends are the primary focus of your investing strategy, then buying AbbVie's shares now that they're yielding 6.3% could make sense.  AbbVie's only paying $120 per share in cash (the rest is being paid in the form of AbbVie stock), and Allergan's book value is $187, so this deal gives AbbVie a bargain source of future cash flow. Allergan generated $5.4 billion in operating cash flow over the past 12 months and AbbVie thinks it can squeeze $2 billion in cost savings out of Allergan by the third year after the deal closes. AbbVie expects the acquisition will boost earnings per share by 10% in year one and by up to 20% over time.  If management's financial modeling is on point, then AbbVie's projected $19 billion in post-deal cash flow will provide plenty of financial firepower to support its dividend and pay down debt. In short, its dividend appears safe for a few more years, at a minimum.  Overall, I think there are better stocks to buy than AbbVie in growth portfolios, but a good argument can be made for including it in dividend portfolios since its dividend yield is so high right now.

A boring automaker with an exciting payout  Nicholas Rossolillo (Ford): The average automaker stock hasn't done much the last couple of years, and for good reason. The number of total vehicles sold globally have been hovering just below all-time highs since 2017. Since auto sales tend to be cyclical, the worry has been that the stagnant figures would eventually give way to all-out decline -- ending the decade-long advance since the financial crisis in 2008.  However, a feared slump has already taken place at Ford. F-Series pickup trucks, Mustangs, and SUV sales have continued to advance in the last year, but sedans have been tanking. Though second-quarter 2019 financials haven't yet been released, the company said U.S. unit sales fell 4% year over year, with big gains in trucks offset once again by fading sedans. The European and Chinese business segments are also getting restructured, and in the meantime bleeding cash. All the while Ford has been investing in everything from electric-vehicle technology to ridesharing to keep up with the times. As a result, the stock has declined some 40% since its most recent peak all the way back in 2014.  Challenges will undoubtedly remain, and even when restructuring is complete Ford will remain nothing more than an old and mostly boring automaker. However, this is a solid business well entrenched in the automotive world. The company has generated over $7.4 billion in free cash flow over the last year and had $20.8 billion in cash and equivalents in the bank at the end of the first quarter of 2019.  That's more than enough to cover the dividend -- which is currently yielding 5.9% a year -- and enough cushion to keep it going if business continues to get worse before it gets better. That makes this stock a worthy pick for investors looking for income generation.  More From The Motley Fool  Anders Bylund has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The announcement of the deal comes on the heels of another pact signed between the companies just a few weeks ago to build thebiggest petrochemical facility in Qatar for producing ethylene.  The latest facility, called the U.S. Gulf Coast II Petrochemical Project (UGSC II), would comprise an ethane cracker, which will process ethane — a byproduct of oil and gas drilling — into 2 million metric tons of ethylene, the building block of plastics, per year. The project will also include two high-density polyethylene units, each having the capacity to process ethylene into 1 million tons of polyethylene, which is the world’s most common plastic.  While Qatar Petroleum will hold a 49% interest in the UGSC II project, Chevron Phillips Chemical will be the majority owner with a 51% stake, and be responsible for operation and management of the facility. Headquartered in Texas, Chevron Phillips Chemical is equally owned by Chevron and Phillips 66, each carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Final investment decision on the project will be made by 2021, with targeted startup of the facility in 2024.The facility is likely to process output from the Permian Basin’s booming hydrocarbon wells.Notably, with Permian producers boosting oil production, the output of gas and liquid by-products is on the rise, in turn providing cheap chemical feedstocks.  Despite the environment backlash, the long-term fundamentals driving demand for plastics and chemicals are likely to remain strong. Chevron Phillips Chemical is cashing in on the trend and believes that petrochemical plants will help meet the demand for plastics in the coming years.  Story continues  Of late, Middle East oil companies are also getting more inclined toward petrochemicals, in an attempt to diversify into other products and regions.The UGSC II plant is the latest example in this regard. This project marks Qatar Petroleum’s first major petrochemical plant in the United States and rivals the scale of the $10-billion petrochemical complex, which is a joint venture between ExxonMobil XOM and SABIC, near Corpus Christi. Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil firm, Saudi Aramco intends to invest around $100 billion in petrochemicals. The company has partnered with France’s TOTAL SA TOT and Daelim to construct a new polyisobutylene plant by 2024. Aramco and TOTAL are also planning to build a petrochemicals complex in Jubail.

The Lone Star State also has some of the biggest stocks in the market, and many investors have gotten rich by choosing the cream of the corporate crop that Texas has to offer.  The popular perception that many outside of Texas have of the state is that there's an oil well in every backyard. It's true that the energy industry has played a key role in the Texas economy for more than a century, and as you'll see below in the list of the biggest Texas stocks, many of the companies that have earned the biggest market capitalizations operate in the oil and gas industry. Yet with a more affordable standard of living, a surplus of open land, a multicultural community that draws people from throughout the Western Hemisphere and beyond, and a spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation, Texas has become a hotbed of enterprise in areas ranging from technology and trade to tourism and healthcare.

Story continues  Lone Star flag flying in front of the Austin, Texas, skyline  Image source: Getty Images.  1. ExxonMobil  ExxonMobil has been a colossus in the oil and gas industry for decades. Exxon's history doesn't begin in Texas, as its origin dates back to the formation of Standard Oil by John D. Rockefeller in 1870. The oil giant decided to move its headquarters from Manhattan to the Dallas suburb of Irving in 1989, and Exxon's merger with Mobil in 1999 cemented its position atop the oil and gas industry.  As an integrated oil major, Exxon's operations span the full range of energy operations. From the upstream oil and gas exploration and production activities that discover and produce the energy products the world relies on, to midstream transportation of those products and downstream refining and marketing efforts, Exxon aims to profit from all of the opportunities its vast resource base offers.  ExxonMobil's lackluster stock return over the past 10 years reflects the volatility of the oil and gas industry. In addition, Exxon shares the difficulty that all large companies face in identifying and taking advantage of changing conditions in their respective businesses.  Yet Exxon hasn't hesitated to use its immense financial resources to seek out new opportunities for growth. The company is currently in the middle of a multiyear plan to boost its investment on new resources, with the intent of ensuring that its production levels will be able to grow even as existing assets are depleted. At the same time, Exxon hopes to play an even bigger role in refining and petrochemical production, putting to use the immense new reserves of oil in the U.S. to make value-added products and bolster profits. Even when crude oil prices have been under pressure, Exxon has been reliably profitable, and a dividend yield that has steadily risen from around 2% a decade ago to more than 4% as of this writing makes the stock even more attractive to income-seeking investors.  2. AT&T  AT&T has a similarly impressive history as ExxonMobil, with its origins dating back to the invention of the telephone. Originally established as Bell Telephone in 1879, the company that became AT&T was the most dominant telecommunications company of the 20th century until antitrust regulators forced it to break up. Regional Bell telephone providers were broken into separate companies, while AT&T continued to focus on long-distance services.  AT&T's Texas connection stems from merger and acquisition activity in the space. When long-distance phone services became so competitive that they stopped producing profits, regional carrier SBC Communications -- formerly Southwestern Bell -- bought AT&T and adopted the former giant's name.  My AT&T logo  Image source: AT&T.  Of course, AT&T has rediscovered prosperity in serving the wireless market as the nation's second-largest wireless carrier. As with the nationwide network of landlines that the company created early in its history, AT&T has invested huge amounts of capital in building and continually upgrading its wireless service. Most recently, the rise of 5G technology has signaled yet another expensive upgrade phase for the industry, and AT&T has had to respond to rising competition in the space by making sure it keeps up with quality improvements among its rivals.  Going forward, AT&T faces the challenge of balancing the prospects for all of its businesses. Although its legacy wireline services are in decline, exposure to areas like media content and cable television could produce new avenues for growth beyond broadband. An above-market dividend yield that has consistently remained in the 4% to 7% range over the past decade provides plenty of incentive for shareholders to hang onto their stock, but most hope that AT&T will be able to add more dramatic growth to lift its share price still further in the years to come.  3. Texas Instruments  For many investors, Texas Instruments' main claim to fame is its pioneering efforts to develop scientific calculators for the masses. It's hard to believe now, but scientists and engineers were once willing to pay the same amount for a TI calculator than you'd pay now to get a high-end smartphone with immense computing capability.  Like many Texas companies, Texas Instruments has roots in the oil and gas industry. The company started out as Geophysical Service in 1930. By the 1950s, though, the invention of the silicon transistor and integrated circuits put TI on the map. Over time, the company has adapted regularly to meet the changing needs of the technology industry.  Now, Texas Instruments has its fingers in a wide variety of industries. Its rugged products meet the needs of the aerospace and defense industry, and its expertise in making consumer goods has extended well beyond calculators to include computer and gaming peripherals. The semiconductor chips and other products TI makes go into mobile devices, data storage devices, and communications equipment for both consumer and industrial use.  A Texas Instruments semiconductor chip  Image source: Texas Instruments.  TI also remains on the cutting edge. In the automotive industry, the company is working on advanced driver assistance, as well as making improvements to entertainment systems and internal electronics. Facilitating the adoption of electric vehicles has also been a growth area for Texas Instruments.  This ability to keep growing has shown up in TI's stock price as well, making it the most successful stock on this list over the past 10 years. With continuing opportunities to keep profiting from advances in the tech field, Texas Instruments is positioned well to remain a leader in the Texas economy and across the tech industry.  4. ConocoPhillips  ConocoPhillips is another major oil and gas production company, with long roots in the Texas community. Conoco moved its headquarters to Houston in 1949, and when it merged with Phillips Petroleum in 2002, the combined company kept its home in the Lone Star State.  Throughout much of its history, ConocoPhillips was an integrated oil company. However, in the early 2010s, the company chose to spin off its midstream and downstream businesses into a separate company under the Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) name. ConocoPhillips held onto its upstream exploration and production business.  ConocoPhillips has worldwide scope, with assets in several key locations. Shale plays have grown in importance over the past decade, and Conoco's assets in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, and Bakken regions have fueled considerable growth in production and output. At the same time, the company also has significant projects in Alaska and has assets in Europe and across the Asia-Pacific region as well. It's those growth opportunities that have given the stock a superior return compared to the much larger ExxonMobil.  In the long run, the oil-price fluctuations that have troubled the energy sector for years aren't likely to stop ConocoPhillips from pursuing its broader strategy. Focusing its efforts on the assets that have the highest potential for growth while divesting its weaker-performing holdings has been a winning strategy during a tough period in the oil patch, and ConocoPhillips has been smart about dividing its capital among reinvestment in high-quality assets, buying back stock, and paying shareholders a dividend that has yielded around 2% to 2.5% over the past several years. Investors should be happy with how the oil giant is working to consolidate its best assets while still keeping an eye out for promising new assets when they become available.  5. Enterprise Products Partners  Enterprise Products Partners' history as a stock dates back to 1998, when the midstream master limited partnership first sold partnership units on the New York Stock Exchange. From there, the company made an extensive number of strategic acquisitions to bulk up its business. Enterprise now gathers, treats, processes, transports, and stores natural gas. It's also a major player in transporting and storing crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs), and it has the capacity to handle various petrochemical products and refined energy products as well.  Enterprise's assets within Texas are considerable. Several of its pipelines run within or through the Lone Star State, and the bulk of its NGL storage capacity is there, too. The MLP has more than two dozen natural gas processing plants, more than half of which are located in Texas, and more than three-quarters of its natural gas liquids fractionation capacity is there. Enterprise's marine terminals on the Houston Ship Channel are essential parts of its import and export capabilities, and crude oil terminals in Midland and Beaumont add to its Houston exposure.  A pipeline terminal facility with networks of pipes  Image source: Enterprise Products Partners.  Enterprise has plenty of ideas for continuing to build out its business, and Texas will play a key role. A new offshore crude oil port near Freeport could add to its international business, and the success of exploration and production companies in finding new resources in key plays like the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin could bring still more demand for pipelines and processing facilities.  Income investors love Enterprise and its MLP peers because of their high dividends, and Enterprise has maintained yields of 4% to 8% consistently over the past decade. Dividends have been an essential part of the growth in Enterprise's unit price over time, but there's still more opportunity for growth in the near future.  6. Crown Castle International  As we noted with AT&T above, the rise of broadband and wireless technology has revolutionized the way people across the globe use technology. In order to give consumers ubiquitous access to communications, there's a huge need for infrastructure assets like cellular towers and fiber networks. Crown Castle concentrates its efforts to build out that infrastructure, and the result has been immense growth in helping its clients provide their end customers with better service.  In particular, Crown Castle has cashed in on the rising demand for mobile data. Rental revenue from its towers and other assets has climbed at a healthy pace, and up to this point, most of those gains have stemmed from client efforts to flesh out their existing 4G networks in order to meet end-user needs.  The companies that turn to Crown Castle for help are only now starting to work on creating viable 5G wireless networks. That means Crown Castle hasn't even begun to see the positive impact on revenue and profit from customers seeking space for their 5G assets. Investors hope that the rise of 5G will be the driver for yet another long wave of growth for Crown Castle.  For shareholders, Crown Castle's structure as a real estate investment trust ensures that the company will pay out most of its profit to its investors as dividends. That's why the REIT's yield has been consistently between 3% and 4%, and there's every reason to think that the rising need for assets throughout the foreseeable future will only power Crown Castle's dividend higher.  7. Schlumberger  Many oil and gas investors focus primarily on the companies that actually drill wells and produce energy products. But behind every exploration and production player, there are countless companies that provide the materials, equipment, services, and expertise that go into making the most of the limited capital budgets that typical E&P companies have.  Schlumberger is a giant in the oilfield services business, and some would argue that it's not really fair to call the company a Texas native. As the correct pronunciation of its name suggests, Schlumberger was founded in France, and it has roughly 100,000 employees scattered across more than 85 countries around the world. However, the company dates its presence in Houston back to the 1930s, and after a stint in New York City, Schlumberger moved back to Texas for good in the mid-2000s.  A worker wearing a Schlumberger hard hat pulling a drill bit out of a trailer  Image source: Schlumberger.  Oilfield services stocks have had an especially difficult time over the past decade, as the decline in oil prices from well above $100 per barrel to much lower levels has had a dramatic effect on how much money Schlumberger's customers have to spend on capital expenditures. In particular, Schlumberger's capacity to provide expertise in deepwater operations, enhanced oil recovery methods, and unconventional resources make it the go-to choice when oil prices are high enough to justify extreme production measures. But when prices fall, producers typically fall back to more conventional and pedestrian methods, and that leaves Schlumberger with unused capacity.  After a couple of years of losses, though, Schlumberger has seen its work to become more efficient finally pay off. Even at somewhat depressed prices, the services company has returned to profitability and has solidly positive free cash flow. If the energy cycle turns back toward higher prices, then Schlumberger will be in a great position to serve its E&P clients with the premium services they need.  8. EOG Resources  The name Enron has become synonymous with corporate corruption and fraud, so it's interesting that the company once known as Enron Oil & Gas was quick to change its name once it became independent from its parent in 1999 -- well before the events that led to Enron's scandal and bankruptcy a couple years later. Yet the company has become an important player in the energy industry, with solid returns and a vast set of high-value assets.  EOG has an extensive presence in Texas, with assets in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Barnett Shale, and Anadarko Basin areas, as well as smaller plays along the Gulf Coast and in the Ark-la-tex area. Yet EOG also has international scope, with key assets in China as well as the Caribbean nation of Trinidad & Tobago. You'll also find an EOG presence in the DJ Basin in northern Colorado, the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, the Williston region of North Dakota and Montana, and the Marcellus Shale along the Appalachian Mountain chain across Pennsylvania.  Even in a tough environment, EOG has worked hard to make the most of its opportunities. It's become more efficient with capital spending, finding top-quality assets and squeezing every barrel of production it can from them. An innovative spirit eschews acquisition-driven growth in favor of painstaking research to make new discoveries, and lower costs have given EOG an advantage over rivals that are more vulnerable to low oil prices.  EOG hasn't been a huge dividend payer, but more recently, the company has recommitted itself to income investors by boosting its payout by more than 70% in just over a year. The moves that EOG has made have put it in position to benefit from higher oil prices in the future.  9. Waste Management  Waste Management is a relatively new Texas company, having moved its corporate headquarters from Chicago to Houston in the late 1990s. The company got its start half a century ago, building on the legacy of one of its co-founders' ancestors, who had hauled wagon-loads of garbage in Chicago in the late 19th century. Now, Waste Management has become a leader not just in removing trash, but in putting it to better use with extensive recycling operations.  The trash business might seem completely unrelated to the energy industry, which is what most investors associate with Texas. However, more recently, Waste Management has opened up new opportunities that put it squarely in the energy business. The company has been a pioneer in using landfill gases to generate electricity, with much of that production going toward powering its fleet of specialty heavy-duty trucks. With the capacity to handle waste of all kinds and the scale to dominate the industry, Waste Management has become a leader in trash, recycling, and renewable energy generation.  Waste Management enjoys some significant barriers to competition that give it an edge. Because there's so much regulation in the handling of various types of waste, it can be difficult for upstart companies to get the approvals necessary to enter the industry. That helps to protect Waste Management from competition, and even though there are some other big players in the waste removal and recycling industry, the overall demand for services is large enough that these companies can divide up customers among themselves and still end up with considerable growth. Waste Management should remain the leading business in its namesake niche for the foreseeable future.  10. Kinder Morgan  Finally, Kinder Morgan is another Texas company with ties to the oil and gas industry. Like Enterprise Products Partners, Kinder Morgan specializes in energy infrastructure, with about 84,000 miles of pipelines and more than 150 terminal locations. The company transports natural gas, crude oil, gasoline, and other energy products as well as carbon dioxide and various chemicals.  Two large oil tanks with pipelines connecting them  Image source: Kinder Morgan.  Houston was Kinder Morgan's birthplace in 1997, with the entity originally getting set up as a master limited partnership. The MLP grew aggressively, and over the years, Kinder Morgan has gone through some transformative changes. Most recently, the company decided to give up the MLP structure and the attendant challenges related to investor accounting in favor of becoming a regular corporation, buying back units of various partnership entities that had given Kinder Morgan such a convoluted business structure.  In recent years, Kinder Morgan has gone through tough times. A 75% dividend cut made many shareholders lose faith in the energy company, and Kinder Morgan has had to take steps to become more efficient. Yet also assisting in the company's recovery has been more extensive activity in the areas that Kinder Morgan serves, especially the boom in shale drilling in the Permian Basin.  Kinder Morgan has big plans for the future, including its efforts to keep expanding to boost exposure to underserved areas both within and beyond Texas. As long as the energy boom in the U.S. continues, you can expect Kinder Morgan to keep helping oil and gas production companies get their products to market.  Don't mess with Texas  Texas is a big place, and the companies that call it home have a major impact on their respective industries. Between a huge presence in energy and the other sectors in which Texas companies have a large presence, investors can find a host of Texas stocks worthy of their consideration.

Morgan Chase on Tuesday reported earnings that exceeded analysts\' expectations, aided by an income tax benefit that boosted results by $768 million.  The bank posted a record second-quarter profit of $9.65 billion, 16% higher than a year earlier, or $2.82 a share, beating the $2.50 estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Revenue of $29.57 billion was 4% higher than a year earlier and edged out expectations of $28.9 billion.  J.P. Morgan said that the presumably one-time tax boost came from the resolution of ""certain tax audits"" that lifted the company\'s per share earnings by 23 cents.  The bank cut its forecast for 2019 net interest income — a main driver of bank profits — by $500 million to $57.5 billion, compared with the $58 billion target in the previous quarter\'s presentation. Shares of J.P. Morgan climbed 0.5% at 10:30 a.m. after falling by as much as 1.8% in premarket trading.  ""With these money-center banks, the yield curve does matter,"" said Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks, who confirmed on CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" that net interest income forecast was pressuring J.P. Morgan\'s stock early Tuesday.  The Federal Reserve signaled that it is preparing to cut its benchmark interest rate later this month, a move that could compress margins on banks\' core lending businesses. Analysts will be keen to ask J.P. Morgan executives how that will impact results in 2019 and beyond. The bank posted record profits in the first and second quarters of this year, helped by higher interest rates -- the last hike was in December -- that boosted results in the firm\'s retail banking operations.  J.P. Morgan is assuming that the Fed will cut rates as many as three times this year, CFO Jennifer Piepszak told reporters on a media call. (Three months ago, they had assumed zero cuts, she said.) If there is just one cut, net interest income could be higher than $57.5 billion, and lower if there are more cuts, she said.  ""The range of outcomes are incredibly broad in terms of the number of rate cuts, and if those rate cuts end up being insurance cuts that ultimately sustain the expansion or whether they end up being in response to real economic slowdown,"" Piepszak said.  The bank\'s fixed income trading division produced $3.69 billion in revenue, a 7% increase that exceeded the $3.36 billion estimate. Meanwhile, its equities trading business generated $1.73 billion in revenue, a 12% drop that missed analysts\' $1.84 billion estimate.  The biggest U.S. bank by assets is closely watched by investors looking for signs of how the industry\'s Main Street and Wall Street businesses did in the period. Bank stocks have rebounded in recent months as strong results from lenders\' retail businesses helped drive firms including J.P. Morgan to record profits, offsetting declining revenues from trading and other Wall Street activities.  In May, J.P. Morgan announced it was acquiring medical payments firm InstaMed for more than $500 million, its biggest takeover since the financial crisis, to push more deeply into the health-care spending market.  The bank also rolled out a digital robo adviser in a bid to persuade banking customers to make investments with the firm.  Last month, J.P. Morgan got approval from regulators to boost its dividend to 90 cents a share from 80 cents and announced a $29.4 billion share repurchasing program.  Earlier this week, Citigroup posted second-quarter profit that exceeded analysts\' expectations on a $350 million boost in revenue from the IPO of bond trading platform Tradeweb.  Here\'s what Wall Street expected for J.P. Morgan:', 'A JP Morgan ship seized by the United States Customs and Border Protection agency was carrying $1.30 billion worth of cocaine.  JP Morgan Ship Seized With Over $1 Billion in Cocaine on Board  The JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) ship was originally searched back in June and that is when authorities found the massive amount of cocaine. The total weight of the drugs found on the ship comes to 20 tons.  Now the United States Customs and Border Protection agency has gone through with paperwork that has the JP Morgan ship seized by it. This isn’t the typical procedure for investigating drug smuggling. Then again, neither is finding 20 tons of cocaine on a ship.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  The JP Morgan ship seized by the United States Customs and Border Protection agency belongs to a fund run by the financial company. What this means is that JPM doesn’t have any specific control over the ship, reports CNNBusiness.  The JP Morgan ship seized by the United States Customs and Border Protection agency is the MSC Gayane. While seizing the entire ship may seem extreme, this is the largest amount of cocaine ever found coming into the U.S. by the agency. With that in mind, officials are looking into the matter to learn more about where the drug came from. It is also looking into individuals connected to the ship.  JP Morgan is keeping its nose out of the case. The company has yet to release any public statement about the seizure of the ship. It also isn’t commenting on the large sum of cocaine found on it, Fox News notes.

Morgan Chase\'s top strategists.  J.P. Morgan markets analyst Marko Kolanovic explained his latest thinking in a note to investors, as he sees the S&P 500 rising to 3,200 over the next year. That would represent an increase of about 6%, which Kolanovic noted is ""quite a bit lower rate of returns ... given that the S&P 500 returned over 20% in 6 months.""  ""However, we think that the unprecedented divergence between various market segments offers a once in a decade opportunity to position for convergence,"" Kolanovic said.  He said he identified a record disparity ""between value/cyclical stocks on one side, and low volatility/defensive stocks on the other side."" What\'s more, Kolanovic said the separation ""is much more significant even when compared to the dot com bubble valuations of late \'90s.""  ""This rotation would push significantly higher all the laggards such as small caps, oil and gas, materials, and more broadly stocks with low P/E and P/B ratios,"" Kolanovic added.  – CNBC\'s Michael Bloom contributed to this report.  WATCH: How JP Morgan Chase became the largest bank in the US']","[""Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson is set to test an experimental HIV vaccine in the U.S. and Europe sometime this year, the company confirmed with CNBC.  The experimental J&J vaccine is a mosaic-based preventative immunization that targets various strains of the HIV virus.  About 1.1 million people in the U.S. and 2 million people in Europe live with HIV, a virus that attacks the body's immune system and makes a person more likely to become sick. If HIV is not treated, it can turn into AIDS, the late stage of HIV in which the virus badly damages the immune system. People with AIDS on average live about three years after their diagnosis, according to HIV.gov.  The company is also conducting a phase 2 clinical trial for the vaccine in Africa, in which 2,600 women in five southern African countries will be immunized. Initial results from that trial are expected by 2021, J&J said.  The J&J trial comes amid President Donald Trump's pledge to end the HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030, a goal which public health advocates have cheered and have sought for years. Pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences , which dominates the $26 billion-a-year HIV drug market, reached an agreement with the Trump administration to donate medications that reduce the risk of HIV transmission for up to 200,000 people a year until 2025.  In late April, J&J and GlaxoSmithKline majority-owned ViiV Healthcare filed a new drug application with the FDA for its once-a-month injection treatment for HIV. In March, the two companies posted late-stage data that showed the shot was as effective as standard daily pills for controlling HIV.

A payment network acts as the technological backbone between you (the consumer) and a merchant\'s bank. Visa\'s VisaNet platform authorizes, clears and settles transactions between you and that merchant\'s bank -- as well as between businesses, across borders, and now, using a variety of forms of payment.  Visa has the world\'s biggest share of card payments outside of China. In its past fiscal year, Visa processed over $11.2 trillion in total transactions, roughly double the amount of second-place Mastercard (MA 2.81%).  Visa is in a great position, with a leading infrastructure platform that\'s almost sure to grow, as the world turns more and more to card and electronic payments and away from cash and checks. You may think you\'re already off of cash, but over $17 trillion in global payments are still conducted via cash or check.  Visa is aiming to get that business, along with even more transactions in the P2P (person-to-person) and B2B (business-to-business) spaces, in the years ahead. Here are some of the newer initiatives at Visa, all of which should make up larger portions of its business five years out.  P2P, B2B, and more  One of Visa\'s more exciting new products is Visa Direct, which does what its name implies: It facilitates direct payment from a consumer to a financial institution, or vice versa, using Visa\'s leading payment network. Basically, Visa has expanded its processing capabilities to direct P2P payments, B2B payments, and even disbursements to workers. In last year\'s annual report, as an example, CEO Alfred Kelly described ride-hailing drivers being able to get paid daily. Visa Direct can often take as little as 30 minutes to process; older and slower ACH (automated clearing house) or check-based systems can take several business days.  Visa Direct has actually been around for 10 years, but its speed and capabilities are just starting to catch on in the U.S. and other developed markets. The company believes the opportunity is huge, at roughly $10 trillion in the U.S. alone -- $1 trillion for P2P, and another $9 trillion for business disbursements. Management also believes the cross-border payments market available for Visa Direct is $6 trillion to $7 trillion.  Thus, the service could expand Visa\'s markets into many more types of transactions, although good old-fashioned credit and debit cards will continue to take share from cash as well.  Blockchain and crypto  One of the new direct payment offerings Visa just unveiled is B2B Connect, its cross-border B2B supplier payments network; it\'s based upon distributed ledger technology, better known as blockchain.  Though Visa is often pigeonholed as an ""old"" payments network, the company has fully embraced new technologies and forms of payment, including blockchain and even cryptocurrencies. Last quarter, Visa signed up Coinbase, one of the major brokerages for buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other cryptocurrencies. The new deal will allow a Visa cardholder to pay for goods and services from a Coinbase account using cryptocurrency, with a Visa credential linked to that account. More recently, Visa announced a partnership with the Libra Association, a governing body overseeing the new Libra digital currency proposed by Facebook (META 4.10%).  Though some may think of new payment technologies as a threat to Visa, the company is determined to partner with every form of payment out there, and open its world-class networks to those flows. In recent years, Visa has transformed its VisaNet networks to become more open-source, and has opened up its leading capabilities to third-party developers via APIs (application programming interfaces), making it simple for companies all over the world to link up with VisaNet.  Going more international  Ease of use is helping Visa to expand more overseas, especially in Europe and India. Visa made a big move in acquiring Visa Europe back in 2016 for $23.4 billion, and just announced last quarter it had completed the full integration.  Though Visa has been in Europe for some time, its European business is still concentrated in the U.K. and Ireland. On the last conference call with analysts, management said: ""[T]here were 12 other markets in Europe with over $200 billion in consumption expenditures. Of these markets, we are well positioned in some and have plenty of room to grow in others.""  Management has also pointed to the long-term growth potential of India, where Visa grew its market share in 2018 to over 4.5 million acceptance points. New tech advancements such as card-linked tokens, in which a customer receives a one-time digital code instead of having to enter sensitive card information, are helping to boost security and authorization rates in these emerging markets.  The more things change...  Visa has a tremendous economic moat in its world-class payments network, and all of these new technological products and geographic expansion plans are really just ways to drive more and more traffic onto VisaNet. Last quarter, Visa grew payments volume and revenue 8%, operating income 9%, and net income an even higher 14%, thanks to the operating leverage generated on a relatively fixed network backbone.  Five years from now, Visa\'s consumer- and business-facing products might be faster, more digital, and more diverse. But the end goal will be the same: to drive traffic to VisaNet.', 'A banner for Snap Inc. hangs on the facade of the the New York Stock Exchange on the eve of the company\'s IPO in New York.

Organic sales growth hit 7% during its fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, outpacing last year\'s lackluster 1% growth. The strong performance was a result of increased demand for health care, beauty, and home care products.

The company posted net a loss of $5.24 billion due to an $8 billion write-down of its Gillette Shave Care business to adjust the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets.  Procter & Gamble\'s shaving business has also been hurt by new competitors like Harry\'s, as well as changing consumer habits.  ""The Shave Care business has also been negatively impacted by market contraction of blades and razors, primarily in developed markets, due to lower shaving frequency, and competitive activities,"" the company said in its earnings report.  The company expects 2020 revenue to grow between 3% and 4% from a year earlier, and estimates it will issue as much as $7.5 billion in dividends and buy back up to $8 billion in stock.  Advertisement  Procter & Gamble is up 30% year-to-date.', 'Despite Procter & Gamble \'s write-down of its struggling Gillette brand, executives expressed confidence about the future of the shaving business.  P&G reported an impairment charge of $8.0 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, resulting in a net loss of $5.24 billion. The one-time, noncash charge was to adjust the carrying values of Gillette\'s goodwill and intangible assets.  ""Grooming continues to be a very attractive business — organic sales up year over year,"" CFO Jon Moeller told analysts on the conference call.  In its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, the company said Gillette has consistently generated ""significant"" earnings and cash flow and continues to be a strategic business with growth opportunities. Last year, Gillette sold $6.22 billion of men\'s razors and blades and $1.28 billion of women\'s razors and blades worldwide, according to Euromonitor data.  The consumer products giant gave two reasons for the write-down. First, the company said that currency devaluations since the carrying values were first established in 2005 played a significant role. Over the last decade, currency has hurt its global business.  ""You\'ve got here a business with a very broad global footprint, and particularly with the year that we have just been through, that impacts that value assessment,"" Moeller said.  P&G\'s second reason for the write-down is the market contraction of blades and razors, primarily in developed markets. In countries like the United States, growing beards is more popular, leading fewer men to buy razors. Gillette held a 52.8% market share of men\'s razors and blades in the U.S. last year, according to Euromonitor.  Additionally, Gillette has faced competition from disruptive upstarts like Dollar Shave Club, now owned by Unilever, and Harry\'s.  ""More recently and much less of an impact, new competitors have entered at prices below the category average,"" Moeller said.  Edgewell Personal Care , parent company of Schick, announced plans to acquire Harry\'s in May. CEO David Taylor told analysts that because both Unilever and Edgewell will count on the start-ups for sales growth, those acquisitions benefit the entire shaving industry.  ""We see it as again a competitive category, but an attractive category,"" Taylor said.  P&G has been trying to rejuvenate Gillette and Venus, its razor brand for women, through new marketing campaigns aimed at millennials and Generation Z. Its direct-to-consumer online business for Gillette remains small but is growing.  Investors shrugged off the write-down Tuesday, instead focusing on the company\'s earnings beat and optimistic forecast for fiscal 2020.

Mezu is a mobile payments app with a linked bank account (and now a debit card) that enables users to pay and collect money. Unlike other mobile payment services, like Venmo and Cash App, Mezu doesn\'t require you to share any personal information when you send or receive money and can be used globally.  ""We created an app that allows people to give and get money using a transaction code rather than their identity,"" Yuval Brisker, co-founder, CEO and president of Mezu, tells CNBC Make It.  The app and debit card can be used both in the U.S. and internationally, which gives Mezu a leg up on competing P2P apps that require users to reside in America. For example, Venmo\'s terms state you must be physically located in the U.S.  With Mezu, there\'s no need to exchange phone numbers or emails. And, your transactions won\'t be shared publicly. That\'s compared to Venmo\'s default settings that make all transactions public for anyone on the app to see. Mezu doesn\'t require you to specify what the payments are for or worry about the public seeing what you spend on.  However, Mezu users do have the option to use the payment service just like other apps — by linking contacts. But, Brisker says the majority of users (67%) opt to use the app\'s private settings — demonstrating consumers desire for anonymity.  ""You can both have privacy and convenience. You can both use technology and maintain control of your personal information,"" Brisker says. ""Choice and options are huge, and that\'s what we\'re trying to do.""  When the privacy setting is turned on, Mezu users can simply give and get money via the Mezu app with a unique, one-time encrypted 4-digit code or QR code. You either enter the code on the Mezu app to get money from someone else or share the code with someone to give money. The app also lets you request money.

(TSX:OTEX)(NASDAQ:OTEX), Evertz Technologies (TSX:ET) and another tech stock are flying high today and there’s more juice to the momentum.  We’ve witnessed positive price growth momentum for months on some of Canada’s most promising tech stocks. The market is elevating these companies’ valuation multiples and investors are willing to pay more per each dollar of future earnings while banking on these firms to deliver better growth, generate higher profits and produce better cash flows in the future.  Here are three of the most-loved tech names that you may want to add one or more to your growing portfolio.  OpenText Corp  OpenText Corporation (TSX:OTEX)(NASDAQ:OTEX) share price is hitting new 52-week highs and recording new all-time highs this year as bullish investors pile onto the steadily growing leader in enterprise information management.  The company’s 2018 performance was plausible, and it has so far reported a 76% growth in cash flow from operations since the beginning of 2018. Likewise, free cash flow generation has been stellar as seen through a 103% growth reported since January last year. Cash is the lifeblood of any organization, and this firm has found a formula to grow plenty of it, thus enabling it to internally fund new growth plans.  Most recently, the company reported another big customer win in Brazil during the first week of July. TIM S/A, one of the South American country’s leading telecom operator, with over 18 million post-paid customers, deployed OpenText’s Customer Experience Management solutions suite while migrating to an e-invoicing system.  TIM’s customers have already fallen in love with the product as the telecom giant reported an over 50% increase in the adoption of digital invoicing by its clients year over year, and I have reason to believe that the new client will be a long-term loyal customer. It’s already realizing significant increases in invoice payment rates after the OpenText solution deployment.  The company has been churning out further good news during the week after announcing a strong partnership with Google during the Enterprise World Toronto event on Tuesday, July 9, 2019 and reporting another key partnership with Mastercard during the week — one that promises to transform global financial processes.  Evertz Technologies  Evertz Technologies Ltd. (TSX:ET) is a designer and manufacturer of video and audio electronic systems infrastructure for the broadcast and film media industry. The business has been gathering strong growth momentum lately — as witnessed through the record revenue and earnings reported in the two most recent quarterly results.  The company reports increasing demand for its solutions from content creators, broadcasters and specialty channels and television service providers as well as telecom operators; it recently consolidated its offering package after acquiring signal management solutions leader Quintech late last year.  Gross margins improved last year and net earnings grew 47% for the fiscal year ended in April just as fourth-quarter diluted earnings increased 118% year over year.  Shares are trading at 52-week highs after hitting $18.94 on Thursday, and the 3.8% dividend yield could be a nice income bonus.  Real Matters  Real Matters Inc. (TSX:REAL) provides a robust network platform linking thousands of field professionals and leading mortgage lenders and insurance providers in the North America.  Revenues have been marginally going down recently as U.S. mortgage originations slowed down, the bottom line suffered and the share price got punished to an agonizing low of $2.95 in November 2018. The company has been consolidating market share during the period and could benefit from increased business volumes should the U.S. Federal Reserve start cutting back interest rates as expected this year.  Shares currently trade near a new 52-week high of $8.02 during the week, but valuation remains severely subdued as compared to near $13 a share soon after the company’s May 2017 initial public offering.  Management believes that the stock is undervalued, and it intends to buy back up to 8% of the company’s public float until June next year after renewing a perfectly timed 2018 share buy-back program, which saw the company buy 4,076,406 shares at an average price of $4.90 apiece in a previous NCIB that expired last month.  The company is expected to release earnings on July 31, and it may be rewarding to watch closely as management promised to focus on operational performance and scale to drive market share growth.  The share price growth momentum could continue if positive progress is reported.', ""Big technology, love it or hate it, is transforming the world we live in. And as a result, technology stocks have been delivering market-beating returns for quite some time. Enter the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 3.31%). Over the last decade, this sector-specific index fund has more than doubled the return of the S&P 500. No matter what surprises have been thrown at it over the last 10 years, VGT has continued to shine.  It looks like technology will continue to lead the economy forward for the foreseeable future. That means VGT might make a good core holding for portfolios of all kinds.  What exactly is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF?  Vanguard is a leader in passive exchange-traded funds, shares of which can be bought and sold just like individual stocks. VGT passively follows the information technology sector, and its underlying holdings are weighted by market cap -- the bigger the company, the bigger its allocation in the fund. The names span software companies, chipmakers, electronic payment processors, and other tech-forward services.  The 10 largest holdings in the ETF are:  Company % Allocation of Vanguard Information Technology ETF Microsoft (MSFT 2.39%) 15.6% Apple (AAPL 1.09%) 14.3% Visa (V 2.55%) 4.5% Mastercard (MA 2.81%) 4% Cisco Systems (CSCO 0.15%) 4% Intel (INTC -0.94%) 3.4% Adobe (ADBE -0.19%) 2.3% Oracle (ORCL 2.91%) 2.2% PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.66%) 2.1% salesforce.com (CRM 3.54%) 2%  The fund thus offers investors exposure to some of the biggest technology powerhouses -- although companies like Amazon (AMZN 3.54%), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 1.20%) (GOOG 1.08%), and Facebook (META 4.10%) are excluded. Amazon is often categorized as a retailer instead of a tech company, and Alphabet and Facebook were reclassified as communications services companies in 2018. (For a fund that includes those heavyweights, check out VGT's closely related peer, the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG 3.19%).) But for a tech pure-play that heavily weights the cream of the crop, but also includes plenty of smaller companies that could end up being tomorrow's leaders (the fund has 335 holdings total), VGT is the way to go.  The why and the how  Even though it has missed out on the gains of a few big technology icons, VGT hasn't been hurting. Not only has the fund smashed the overall market, it is also handily outpacing the other funds that follow the IT sector. Even the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW 3.48%) (which includes Google and Facebook) and the First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF (FDN 2.60%) (which includes Amazon, Google, and Facebook) haven't matched its results over the long term.  Fund Annual Expense Ratio Trailing 10-Year Total Return Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 3.31%) 0.10% 178% Fidelity MSCI Information Technology ETF (FTEC 3.31%) 0.08% 166% Technology SPDR ETF (XLK 3.32%) 0.13% 163% iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW 3.48%) 0.43% 162% First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF (FDN 2.60%) 0.52% 167%  The near non-existent cost of ownership (not including brokerage fees to buy and sell shares) is the primary reason Vanguard's take on the IT index has outperformed. Granted, the Fidelity fund is now on par as far as expenses go, and is nearly identical in its underlying holdings, so either fund should be a good choice going forward.  As to specifics of ownership, I typically recommend my clients have a minimum of 10 to 20 individual stocks. If that isn't possible because your account is too small, then VGT is a great way to get in on a lot of fast-growing tech companies without needing to fret about diversification. Thus, for investors who are just getting started, or who are looking to quickly increase their IT exposure, VGT is a good solution.  Retirees living off of their investments may wish to keep their exposure small. That's because VGT can be volatile. It's a growth fund, and its laser-focus on technology makes it even more prone to up-and-down swings. However, Vanguard lists the blended price-to-trailing-12-month-earnings ratio of the fund at 21.0, lower than the 22.8 for the S&P 500 index. That makes the IT index a relative value considering its higher expected long-term growth. Thus, for retirement portfolios in need of some potential stock growth, one could do worse than VGT.  Whether it's for someone who is just beginning to build their investment portfolio, or for someone who wants to get a little extra pep without hand-picking stocks, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a solid buy. It offers diversification, high-quality businesses, and plenty of growth potential with extremely low fees. For those looking to stay in IT for the long haul, this ETF should be a top pick.""]","[""Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!  Investors pursuing a solid, dependable stock investment can often be led to Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), a large-cap worth US$237b. Doing business globally, large caps tend to have diversified revenue streams and attractive capital returns, making them desirable investments for risk-averse portfolios. But, the health of the financials determines whether the company continues to succeed. Let’s take a look at Pfizer’s leverage and assess its financial strength to get an idea of their ability to fund strategic acquisitions and grow through cyclical pressures. Remember this is a very top-level look that focuses exclusively on financial health, so I recommend a deeper analysis into PFE here.  Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer  Does PFE Produce Much Cash Relative To Its Debt?  Over the past year, PFE has ramped up its debt from US$41b to US$47b – this includes long-term debt. With this increase in debt, PFE's cash and short-term investments stands at US$12b to keep the business going. Additionally, PFE has produced cash from operations of US$16b in the last twelve months, resulting in an operating cash to total debt ratio of 33%, signalling that PFE’s debt is appropriately covered by operating cash.  Can PFE meet its short-term obligations with the cash in hand?  At the current liabilities level of US$29b, it appears that the company has been able to meet these commitments with a current assets level of US$45b, leading to a 1.54x current account ratio. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Generally, for Pharmaceuticals companies, this is a reasonable ratio since there's a sufficient cash cushion without leaving too much capital idle or in low-earning investments.  NYSE:PFE Historical Debt, July 16th 2019  Does PFE face the risk of succumbing to its debt-load?  With debt reaching 77% of equity, PFE may be thought of as relatively highly levered. This isn’t uncommon for large companies because interest payments on debt are tax deductible, meaning debt can be a cheaper source of capital than equity. Consequently, larger-cap organisations tend to enjoy lower cost of capital as a result of easily attained financing, providing an advantage over smaller companies. The sustainability of PFE’s debt levels can be assessed by comparing the company’s interest payments to earnings. A company generating earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at least three times its net interest payments is considered financially sound. For PFE, the ratio of 20.4x suggests that interest is comfortably covered. Large-cap investments like PFE are often believed to be a safe investment due to their ability to pump out ample earnings multiple times its interest payments.  Story continues  Next Steps:  Although PFE’s debt level is towards the higher end of the spectrum, its cash flow coverage seems adequate to meet obligations which means its debt is being efficiently utilised. Since there is also no concerns around PFE's liquidity needs, this may be its optimal capital structure for the time being. Keep in mind I haven't considered other factors such as how PFE has been performing in the past.

Tucked behind the mega-pharmaceutical deal between Pfizer and Mylan is weakness in Pfizer\'s earnings, according to Morgan Stanley.  The firm downgraded Pfizer to equal-weight from overweight and slashed it price target to $40 per share from $48 per share on Tuesday.  ""Pfizer announced it is exiting its Upjohn business, but the real news was weaker underlying earnings"" in the businesses that remain, Morgan Stanley\'s David Risinger said in a note to clients.', ""Big pharma titan Pfizer (PFE -0.40%) is on a roll. Since swapping out former CEO Ian Read for the more forward-thinking Albert Bourla earlier this year, the company has advanced a proposed joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline designed to dump its underperforming consumer healthcare unit, and acquired the promising oncology company Array BioPharma in a cost-effective $11.4 billion deal. Now, Pfizer is on the cusp of finally addressing its biggest overhang -- its vast portfolio of declining former star medicines.  Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer is negotiating a deal to combine its off-patent drug business with generic drug giant Mylan (MYL) in an all-stock transaction. Mylan shareholders will reportedly own approximately 43% of the new venture, and Pfizer's shareholders will own the other 57%. Pfizer will also walk away with a healthy $12 billion in proceeds from the sale of debt. The new company will be renamed and rebranded after the deal officially closes.  Should investors cheer -- or jeer -- this planned spin-off?  A win-win situation  This proposed transaction has all the ingredients to be a major win for both companies. Mylan's business has been faltering of late due to a variety of headwinds. This deal would give the company a slate of proven revenue generators like Lipitor and Viagra that should greatly beef up its free cash flows on a forward-looking basis.  Equally as critical, embattled CEO Heather Bresch would reportedly be replaced by Michael Goettler, who currently heads up Upjohn. Wall Street has long been clamoring for a change in leadership at Mylan, given that the company has thus far failed to get out ahead of any of its fundamental problems. Goettler's appointment as CEO should appease most of Mylan's biggest critics.  Pfizer, on the other hand, has been looking for a way to unload its legacy products business for what seems like forever. Even under former CEO Ian Read, it was searching for a strategy to divest itself of its off-brand drug segment so that it could spotlight its newer products like the breast cancer medicine Ibrance and the mega-blockbuster vaccine Prevnar 13. This transaction would certainly tick that all-important box, and transform Pfizer into a smaller, more nimble, growth-oriented company.  First a sale, and then...a purchase?  Assuming this spinoff goes off without a hitch, Pfizer will almost certainly follow it up by pursuing a bolt-on acquisition to shore up its innovative products business. While most analysts will likely point to oncology as the drugmaker's preferred hunting ground, it also might turn to orphan medicines. Pfizer, after all, already has a formidable oncology portfolio following the Array deal, and there are a number of extremely attractive takeover targets in the rare disease space right now.  Which rare disease companies might Pfizer target? BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Sarepta Therapeutics, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 1.86%) are three names to keep an eye on. Each sports at least one franchise-level medicine, as well as a variety of high-value clinical assets. Vertex, for instance, has a virtual monopoly in cystic fibrosis, and also aims to make inroads in the muscular dystrophy market via its recent gene-editing collaboration with Crispr Therapeutics. Those are two enormous markets that could lure a growth-hungry suitor like Pfizer.  Bottom line: This proposed Mylan transaction only sets the table for Pfizer to make additional business development moves in the near future. The drugmaker, after all, clearly needs at least one more big bolt-on acquisition like Vertex -- or perhaps a handful of smaller tuck-in deals -- to truly flesh out its innovative medicines business.""]","['The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade tomorrow. The last time the Fed cut rates after a string of hikes was back in September 2007, just before the financial crisis. Following that cut, several stocks took a massive hit over the subsequent month, including Dow component Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD). (These stocks, meanwhile, rallied after the rate cut.)  Below are the 25 S&P 500 Index (SPX) stocks that fared the worst after the September 2007 cut, looking one month out. Per data from Schaeffer\'s Senior Quantitative Analyst, several housing stocks took a hit, though that preceded the sector\'s bubble bursting. In addition, construction material providers Lowe\'s (LOW) and Home Depot were pummeled, with the latter falling 12.9% into mid-October 2007. In fact, HD was the only Dow stock (at the time) to make the list.  worst stocks after fed rate cut  Home Depot shares have been on fire in 2019, up roughly 27% year-to-date. In fact, HD just notched a record peak of $219.29 on July 15, blowing past former resistance in the $205-$215 region. At last check, the stock has dropped 0.1% to trade at $217.81.  HD stock chart july 30  Another post-rate-cut pullback would throw quite a few analysts off-guard. Considering HD\'s impressive run this year, it\'s not surprising the blue chip boasts 12 ""buy"" or better endorsements, compared to just seven lukewarm ""holds"" and not a single ""sell"" rating.  Meanwhile, traders wanting to speculate on HD\'s near-term options can do so at a relative discount still, with the company\'s next earnings release not until Aug. 20. The equity\'s Schaeffer\'s Volatility Index (SVI) of 17% is in just the 15th percentile of its annual range, pointing to relatively modest premiums being priced into short-term option contracts.  Likewise, the stock sports a Schaeffer\'s Volatility Scorecard (SVS) of 95 (out of a possible 100). This lofty reading indicates that HD shares have handily exceeded options traders\' volatility expectations during the past year -- a boon for would-be premium buyers.', 'More doing, and more donating — that’s the power of this Home Depot co-founder.  Atlanta billionaire Bernie Marcus is worth an estimated $4.53 billion, according to Bloomberg, or $5.8 billion by Forbes’ estimate. And he tells the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a new interview that he plans to give 80% to 90% of that wealth to charity when he dies.  Marcus, 90, said that he has given more than $2 billion to 300-plus organizations across the globe in his lifetime. The Home Depot HD, +1.97% co-founder and his wife, Billi, joined the Giving Pledge launched by Microsoft MSFT, +2.35% founder Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010, a commitment by the world’s wealthiest people to donate at least half of their fortunes. “To make quarterly profits is one thing, but changing just one life is so much better,” Marcus said when he joined.  Buffett also announced on Monday that he would donate about $3.6 billion in Berkshire Hathaway shares to five foundations as part of that pledge, and Mackenzie Bezos, who became one of the world’s richest women following her divorce from Amazon AMZN, +3.55% founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, also joined the philanthropic promise earlier this year.  Related:Warren Buffett to donate Berkshire shares worth $3.6 billion to 5 foundations  And: Jeff Bezos is ‘proud’ of ex-wife’s pledge to give away over half of her $35 billion fortune: ‘Go get ’em MacKenzie’  Marcus declined to share his net worth or predict exactly how much he’ll give away. But with his wealth guessed to be in the range of $4.53 and $5.8 billion, combined with the $2 billion he says he’s already given away, the Atlanta newspaper puts his potential total philanthropy in the ballpark of $6 billion.  He has left instructions with his Marcus Foundation to share the wealth with charitable causes. His priorities include medical discoveries and treatments for kids with autism, and creating 20 to 25 centers across the country to aid veterans suffering from brain injuries and PTSD.  “‘I’ve got all the houses I need. I live very well. My kids are taken care of. Everything I live for now is finding the right things to put my money into and that can give me a rate of return in emotion and doing good things for this world.’” — Bernie Marcus  He and his wife have also donated $250 million to build the Georgia Aquarium, and millions more to the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta.  “Every day of my life, there are new challenges for me that I want to get involved with,” said Marcus.  And that includes politics, although not to the extent of his philanthropic giving. He told the paper that he would be donating to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, even though “his communication sucks,” Marcus said of the president.  “He’s got a businessman’s common-sense approach to most things,” Marcus said. “Now, do I agree with every move that he makes? No, I don’t. But the truth is he has produced more than anybody else. He has. If we look at this country, I would say that we are better off today than we were eight years ago or six years ago.”  Marcus retired as Home Depot’s chairman in 2002. And he isn’t worried anymore about competition from Amazon hurting the $231 billion company that he helped start.  Related:Home Depot sees opportunity in tool rental  Home Depot, which generates about $108 billion in annual sales, “is doing well because they understand the philosophy of reinventing themselves,” he said. “At one point, we had real concern that Amazon was going to put everybody out of business. I don’t feel that is true today. … They are not going to run away with our business.”']","[""Last week, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) reported that sales continued to rise at an impressive pace in June. In fact, underlying sales trends improved compared to May in all of its markets.  This news helped lift Costco stock to a new all-time high. Shares of the discount warehouse club giant have surpassed $280: up 30% over the past year and up 84% over the past two years.  COST Chart  Costco Stock Performance, data by YCharts.  Costco Wholesale is certainly a great company with a wide moat and a long track record of growth. However, Costco stock now appears to trade at an excessive valuation relative to its growth rate. As a result, investors should probably wait for a better buying opportunity.  Another great month  Net sales rose 7.5% to $14.57 billion at Costco last month. Comparable sales rose 5.4%, or 5.1% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of currency fluctuations, changes in gasoline prices, and new accounting rules implemented for fiscal 2019. This performance beat analysts' expectations. It also represented an improvement over Costco's 4.3% adjusted comp sales gain for the month of May.  Sales trends were relatively consistent across all of Costco's major geographic regions. Adjusted comp sales rose 5.3% in the U.S., 4.3% in Canada, and 5.5% in the rest of the world. Higher traffic was the biggest driver of Costco's sales growth, with comparable-store traffic up 3.7% worldwide, including a 3.4% increase in the domestic market.  Growth was also consistent across all of Costco's broad merchandise categories. That said, the company continues to report particularly strong sales growth for items like toys, apparel, and housewares, for which competitors' store closures have significantly reduced competition over the past year or two.  The entrance to a Costco warehouse  Costco's strong sales growth continued last month. Image source: Costco Wholesale.  Management noted that Costco is posting its strong comp sales growth even as it opens new warehouses at a steady pace, cannibalizing sales from existing locations. Cannibalization hurt comp sales growth by about 0.8 percentage points last month, according to the company.  Story continues  Profit growth is set to slow  After a weak start to the year, Costco reported massive earnings growth for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Last quarter -- the third quarter of Costco's fiscal year -- earnings growth moderated, with operating income rising 5.2% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 11%, but some one-time tax items drove a substantial portion of that earnings growth.  Earnings growth is likely to continue at a more moderate pace -- on average, at least -- over the next several years. That's because some of the biggest tailwinds that have driven Costco's earnings growth in recent years are fading.  Most importantly, Costco raised its annual membership fee in the U.S. and Canada by about 9% two years ago. Because of the way the company accounts for membership fees, the extra revenue filters into its financial results over the course of 23 months. That has provided a sizable boost to its earnings growth over the past two years, because membership fees account for the vast majority of Costco's profit. However, Costco only raises its fees every five or six years, so investors will have to do without this earnings tailwind for the next several years.  Costco stock is just too pricey right now  Following its recent rally, Costco stock trades for about 35 times its projected fiscal 2019 earnings per share (EPS) of $8.04. That's nearly double the forward P/E ratio of the broader market.  To be fair, Costco does have more room for long-term sales growth than the average company. Its massive purchasing power -- which allows it to beat rivals' prices consistently -- and strong customer loyalty should enable Costco to grow revenue at a high-single-digit annual rate for many years to come.  That said, analysts expect modest EPS growth of about 6% next year, roughly in line with Costco's projected sales growth of 7%. That's not enough earnings growth to justify the stock's current valuation. There are better opportunities for investors in the market today, and there will probably be better entry points for buying Costco stock in the years ahead.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy."", ""At $60 a year, a basic Costco (COST 1.60%) membership makes sense for anyone who regularly shops at the warehouse club. Some people, however, don't enjoy shopping in bulk, or they lack the room to store items bought in larger quantities. In other cases people simply prefer buying things from a more full-service chain, meaning joining Costco would be a waste of money.  Costco, however, offers all sorts of perks that go beyond what's sold in its stores. One of those -- cheap gas -- isn't offered at every location. But if you live near one of the chain's locations that offers gas, it might make sense to join simply for access to its pumps.  Should you join Costco just for gas?  Before you consider Costco's gas prices, you need to think about two things. First, do you live close enough to the warehouse club or pass by one on your normal commute to make getting gas there feasible? Second, do you drive enough to make saving money on gas worthwhile?  If you check off both of those boxes, the next factor to consider is price. Costco generally has gas at cheaper prices than other stations in the area, but it won't always be the cheapest (though it's usually close).  For example, in the area where I live in Southern Florida gas averaged $2.65 a gallon as of July 7, while Costco had it for $2.47 a gallon according to data from GasBuddy. In this case, the warehouse club is the lowest-price station in its general area -- but there's slightly cheaper gas at a station that's right next to the highway a few miles away.  If you're the type of person who just gets gas when it's convenient, let's assume you pay the average of $2.67 a gallon. If you use 10 gallons a week and get it from Costco, you're saving $0.18 a gallon or $1.80 per tank. Assume you use one tank a week for 52 weeks a year, you will save $93.60. That, of course, is a very simplistic example, but it does show that for at least some people joining Costco just for access to cheap gas makes sense.  Is it right for you?  If Costco isn't convenient, on the other hand, doing this makes little sense. But if you drive by the warehouse club regularly and can fill up there about two-thirds of the time, it probably makes sense to join.  Of course, once you have access to Costco you're not limited to just buying gas there. Even if you don't like venturing inside its store you can still use its online service, which now includes limited delivery. Basically, if you pay for your membership through what you save in gas, then everything else you use it for becomes gravy.  This approach to Costco membership takes discipline and a bit of planning, though. You need to think about filling your tank strategically, and that will sometimes mean getting gas before you really need it. Still, while this may be an extreme way of using the warehouse club, it's a smart move that lets even more people justify the cost of joining."", ""Gas at Costco is almost always cheaper than what you'd find at other gas stations in the US.

And it makes tracking the top stocks of a sector easier for CNBC\'s Jim Cramer, who curated the so-called FANG group and on Thursday introduced a new simple name for retailers with scale — ""WATCH.""  Scale is a business\' capability to grow operations and sales while maintaining costs. As Cramer put it: it\'s ""a company that\'s big enough and powerful enough to control its own destiny.""  ""A company that scales is one that survives and then thrives in even the toughest environment,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""As an investor, you need recognize which businesses can scale because those are the ones that win. Like Amazon , like Microsoft , like WATCH.""  Microsoft, the computer giant that competes Amazon in the cloud industry with its Azure business, is not in the WATCH list because it is not a retailer. Amazon, the internet behemoth that has disrupted the shopping experience, however, did along with Walmart , Target , Costco and Home Depot .  What they all have in common is innovation, Cramer said.  ""One of the biggest ... benefits of scaling is that it keeps your suppliers in check and that keeps your gross margins up and makes it so that we like your stock more,"" he said. ""That\'s the main reason I\'ve created a brand new acronym for the very few retailers that have enough scale to [have] control over their costs and therefore their destiny.""']","[""PepsiCo (PEP -0.43%) has delivered solid returns for investors in recent years, during a period when many of its peers in the consumer staples industry have been struggling. The company's booming snack food business has been compensating for sluggish demand for sweet drinks and diet sodas, and pushing overall sales higher. In fact, in the first quarter, PepsiCo reported its fastest growth in years.  Investors are expecting strong, but more modest, results when PepsiCo announces second-quarter results on Tuesday.  The portfolio checkup  PepsiCo's diverse product lineup is a key reason why investors like the stock. But it also tends produce uneven results across brands like Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Quaker, and Diet Pepsi. Similar to Coca-Cola (KO -0.11%), PepsiCo has reported weak organic sales volumes in its beverage segment. But the difference between it and its chief rival has been its booming snack division, which propelled its overall sales upward by more than 5% last quarter, its fastest growth rate in three years.  CEO Ramon Laguarta and his team predicted weaker growth over the next few quarters, in part because the company has to deal with manufacturing bottlenecks, as well as sluggish demand for diet sodas and for many of its food brands. Investors will find out on Tuesday whether those challenges ended PepsiCo's nine-month streak of accelerating sales growth, and whether that forecast slowdown was modest, or big enough to lead management to downgrade its outlook.  Spending money  PepsiCo is predicting that earnings will drop by about 1% in fiscal 2019 as the company spends aggressively on initiatives like upgrading its supply chain and giving its brands more marketing support. Executives said back in April that it was still too soon to tell whether these projects were paying off; they might have more clarity to give investors this week.  The more important metric to watch when it comes to profitability will be sales volume, which only contributed 1 percentage point of PepsiCo's 5% revenue increase last quarter. The company will need a better balance of growth from sales volumes and rising prices if it's going to meaningfully increase its expansion pace. If management again leaves its modest 4% revenue growth target in place on Tuesday, it might be due to its continuing difficulties in this area.  Capital returns  The outlook is more decidedly positive when it comes to direct shareholder returns. In fact, investors can anticipate about $8 billion of Pepsi's $9 billion in operating cash flow will be returned to them through dividends and stock repurchases this year. Coke, by contrast, is forecasting both slower growth and a lower overall cash year in 2019.  Laguarta and his team aren't likely to shift those capital return goals this week. However, with half of the fiscal year behind them, executives will have a better idea about where sales and earnings might end up.  That knowledge will inform their aggressiveness as they seek to spend about $3 billion on stock buybacks this year, and decide how much to next increase the dividend by. Assuming it comes on schedule, that will be PepsiCo's 47th consecutive annual payout boost."", 'Facing public pressure over contributions to plastic pollution, drink makers Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are cutting ties this year with a trade association representing the plastics industry.  The beverage giants join other companies like household products company Clorox , medical device firm Becton Dickinson and hygiene and cleanings tech company Ecolab , which ended memberships with the Plastics Industry Association last year.  The organization, representing manufacturers, has lobbied for states to prohibit plastic bans across the country. Some of the firms that left in 2018 cited disagreements with the lobbying group over plastic bag preemption laws.  ""We withdrew earlier this year as a result of positions the organization was taking that were not fully consistent with our commitments and goals,"" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told CNBC.  A PepsiCo spokesperson said that the company initially joined the Plastics Industry Association to learn about material innovation, but will end its membership at the end of the year since it ""does not participate in the policy advocacy work of the association or its subsidiaries.""  Neither company expanded on the exact policies of the Plastics Industry Association that caused them to part ways. Members of the Plastics Industry Association include Toyota and SC Johnson, according to committee lists from 2018 reviewed by CNBC.  Patty Long, interim president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, told CNBC that environmental group Greenpeace has been pressuring several brands that are members of the plastics group to leave.  ""This is unfortunate — consumer brands are integral to making sustainability commitments into realities, by working with their suppliers to make lasting change,"" she wrote in an email. ""For example, our members work together to align their efforts to put recycling and sustainability at the forefront of their businesses.""  Last year, Greenpeace found that Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestle were the world\'s biggest producers of plastic trash, mostly of polystyrene, which goes into packaging, and PET, which is used in bottles and containers.  The firms have pledged to reduce plastic waste and fix U.S. recycling. Coca-Cola says that by 2025, all its packaging will be recyclable, reusable or compostable. Pepsi also aims to have its products be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025.  Despite the companies breaking ties with the plastic organization, and setting goals that resonate with environmentally conscious consumers calling for less waste, the companies have still been advocates in the push against legislation that would result in more recycling.  For instance, the companies for years have fought against legislation known as ""bottle bills,"" which require deposits to be paid on beverages sold in recyclable bottles and cans. Advocates say these bills result in more products being recycled, but it can come at a much higher cost for the corporations.

""According to supply chain checks, production has already begun for all 4 new models, with the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max delayed by 2 weeks relative to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro,"" said Huberty. Morgan Stanley also raised its 2021 iPhone shipment estimates to 220 million units from 218 million units. Huberty said this iPhone launches comes at a ""key time"" as the replacement cycle for phones has growth to over four years. ""In our view, Apple\'s upcoming portfolio of new 5G-enabled devices, when combined with increasing adoption (and distribution) of iPhone trade-ins and financing plans and the potential for further share gains in key markets such as EMEA and China on the back of Huawei technology restrictions, will contribute to contracting replacement cycles,"" Huberty added. Shares of Apple are up more than 56% this year. The event starts at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Tuesday.  Tim Cook on stage at Apple\'s September 10, 2019 event. Source: Apple', 'Tim Cook recently celebrated his 9th anniversary as Apple (AAPL 1.09%) CEO in August, a promotion that earned him a hefty compensation package that primarily consisted of restricted stock units (RSUs). Tranches of that original grant have been vesting over the years as the company achieves certain performance milestones under his leadership.  Apple\'s board of directors this week granted Cook another package of RSUs, the first since that 2011 award. Cook is worth every penny.  Cook has created incredible value for shareholders  The Cupertino tech giant has given the chief executive 333,987 fresh RSUs, according to regulatory filings. The grant is scheduled to vest in thirds, starting on April 1, 2023, with another third vesting in each of the successive two years. The grant also includes performance-based RSUs that could potentially triple the total number of RSUs that Cook receives, depending on the relative total return of Apple stock between the start of fiscal 2021 and the end of fiscal 2023. Those performance-based RSUs will vest on Oct. 1, 2023.  Based on current share prices, that would put the maximum value of the grant at around $116 million. That\'s undoubtedly a generous compensation package, but Cook\'s net worth trails many tech CEOs since he wasn\'t a founder. Cook\'s net worth only recently topped $1 billion, a threshold that many founder CEOs clear easily due to larger ownership stakes.  Perhaps more importantly, Cook has earned it due to the sheer amount of shareholder value that he creates. Apple\'s market cap has grown by over 450% under his leadership, becoming the first U.S. company to reach $2 trillion. Incidentally, the stock hit that historic milestone just days before Cook\'s 9th anniversary as CEO.  Beyond market valuation, Apple\'s business has grown significantly. The core iPhone business flourished, and Apple entered new markets like wearables with Apple Watch and AirPods.  Recognizing that the smartphone market was maturing and that unit sales were plateauing, Cook helped shift the investing narrative toward a booming services business as a way to monetize all those iPhones over the long haul. That strategy has resonated with investors, who have rewarded Apple with a premium market valuation for the first time in years.  ""Tim has brought unparalleled innovation and focus to his role as CEO and demonstrated what it means to lead with values and integrity,"" the company\'s board said in a statement. ""For the first time in nearly a decade, we are awarding Tim a new stock grant that will vest over time in recognition of his outstanding leadership and with great optimism for Apple\'s future as he carries these efforts forward.""', 'Apple (AAPL) will report FQ4 earnings on Thursday evening in what will as per usual be one of earnings season’s highlights. This September quarter’s results, however, will have a different flavor, due to the well-publicized delay to the new iPhone’s release. An issue Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes will be on investors’ minds when Apple releases its quarterly financial results.  “We expect a solid Sept-qtr report from AAPL, but see investors overlooking any recent strength/weakness and focusing on the Dec-qtr given the recent iPhone release and impact on guidance and the Mar-qtr beyond, as this is the first time that all new iPhone products are a month or more delayed. With only a week of new iPhone sales by the time earnings are reported on 10/29, we are unsure that AAPL will feel comfortable with guidance,” Ong wrote.  In fact, Apple has not provided any official guidance since January, while for the December quarter, the tech giant usually has 1.5 months of sales data to base the guidance on, it is a luxury the company does not have this time around.  As for the September quarter’s results, Ong expects revenue of $62.7 billion, indicating a 5% quarter-over-quarter uptick yet down by 2% year-over-year. The Street’s forecast calls for $63.8 billion. Ong’s EPS estimate stands at $0.69 compared to the Street’s $0.70 estimate.  In contrast to Apple, Ong does provide guidance for the next quarter and expects revenue to increase by 9% year-over-year and 60% quarter-over-quarter to $100.1 billion, slightly below the Street’s call for $100.6 billion. On the bottom line, Ong expects EPS of $1.37, the same as the Street’s estimate.  As a side note, the 5-year average quarter-over-quarter increase for revenue in the Dec Quarter stands at 52%. “Given the lack of 1 week of new iPhone revenues in the Sept-qtr due to the delayed release, we would expect AAPL to beat seasonality comfortably in the Dec-qtr,” Ong added.  All in all, ahead of the print, Ong reiterates a Buy rating on AAPL shares along with a $140 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Ong’s track record, click here)  Story continues  Apple has decent support on the Street with 26 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell coalescing to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $125.81, the average price target suggests room for an 8% uptick.

It is very important to do your own analysis before making any investment.', 'Apple (AAPL 1.09%) announced Tuesday that it will hold a digital-only event next week, on Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2020 at 1 p.m. EDT at the Steve Jobs Theater at the company\'s Cupertino, California campus. Unlike previous years, the presentation will be an online presentation only due to the coronavirus.  The company has historically used such events as the launchpad for its next gen iPhone, and Apple is widely expected to announce that the highly anticipated iPhone 12 will be powered by the next generation of cellular technology -- 5G. The teaser for the event, ""Hi, Speed,"" likely refers to the much greater network speeds capable with 5G, which can be nearly 100 times faster than the previous generation.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives sees this as a key announcement for Apple investors. ""Across the board we are seeing an uptick around production and pent-up demand for the slate of iPhone 12 models (expecting 4 new models) set to be unveiled next week in this launch event,"" the analyst wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. He also suggested that the latest iPhones would hit shelves and websites in late October, which would be consistent with its release schedule in previous years following the announcement of a new device.  Recent supply chain checks by Ives indicate ""stepped-up demand"" for a larger 6.7"" model that is expected to make its debut, which would mark the largest iPhone ever. The company is also expected to introduce a more compact model at 5.4"", making it the smallest iPhone in the lineup.  This could be the beginning of the much ballyhooed ""super cycle"" for Apple. Ives anticipates that as many 350 million of the 950 current iPhone users will upgrade to the upcoming version of the device, resulting in an ""unprecedented upgrade cycle"" for Apple in the coming months.']","['But one of the fastest-growing parts of Microsoft, the Azure public cloud for hosting applications and websites, grew 48%, accelerating from 47% in the prior quarter. Microsoft doesn\'t disclose revenue from Azure in dollars. Analysts had expected around 44% growth.  Revenue for commercial PCs cratered 22% months after support for Windows 7 ended and the coronavirus pandemic took hold; the category had surged last year, making outperformance this year more difficult.  In the fiscal first quarter, Microsoft revenue grew 12% on an annualized basis, down from 13% growth in the prior quarter, according to a statement .  With respect to guidance, Microsoft expects $39.5 billion to $40.4 billion in fiscal second-quarter revenue, Amy Hood, the company\'s chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call. The middle of that range, at $39.95 billion, implies 8% annualized growth, and it\'s below the Refinitiv consensus estimate of $40.43 billion. Hood suggested that softer business demand would continue to cut into Windows licensing revenue.  Microsoft shares moved 2% lower in extended trading on Tuesday after the company reported quarterly revenue guidance that fell short of analysts\' expectations. Fiscal first-quarter earnings exceeded estimates, though.  Microsoft\'s Intelligent Cloud segment, featuring Azure, Enterprise Services, GitHub and server products such as SQL Server and Windows Server, contributed $12.99 billion in revenue, up 20% year over year and more than the $12.73 billion consensus among analysts polled by FactSet.  The Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Dynamics, LinkedIn and Office, delivered $12.32 billion in revenue. That\'s up 11% and higher than the $11.78 billion FactSet consensus. Teams, one part of the Office 365 productivity app bundle, now has over 115 million daily active users, up from 75 million in April, CEO Satya Nadella said on the call.  Revenue from the More Personal Computing segment, containing search advertising, Surface, Windows and Xbox, came to $11.85 billion. That means the segment\'s revenue grew 6% year over year, and it was above the $11.18 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by FactSet. Microsoft will release the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles on Nov. 10, and Hood called for gaming revenue growth in ""the high 20% range"" in the fiscal second quarter, which would be up sequentially from 21.6% growth in the fiscal first quarter.  Licensing revenue from Windows device makers declined 5% in the quarter, and licensing revenue for commercial devices in particular fell some 22%, compared with the 4% decrease in the prior quarter, the worst performance in more than five years. Technology industry research company Gartner estimated that third-quarter PC shipments grew 3.7% year over year and saw the fastest growth in the U.S. in a decade.  Microsoft\'s search advertising business declined 10%, and Hood said Microsoft sees a ""decline in the mid to high single-digit range"" in the fiscal second quarter.  The Commercial Cloud collection of products, including Azure, Dynamics 365, commercial LinkedIn and Office 365 services, added up to $15.2 billion in revenue, representing almost 41% of total revenue, up from around 38% in the prior quarter. Commercial Cloud gross margin was 71%, passing the 70% mark for. the first time.  This is the first quarter Microsoft benefits from an accounting change that extended the useful life of its server equipment from two years to four years.  In the quarter Microsoft announced the $7.5 billion acquisition of Zenimax Media, the company behind video game franchises such as Doom and Quake, and Microsoft failed to make a deal involving the video-sharing app TikTok.  In January, Microsoft announced a goal to be carbon-negative, which would involve removing more carbon than it emits, by 2030. In the fiscal first quarter Microsoft provided an update, saying it had extended an internal carbon tax to all parts of its operations and updated its code of conduct for suppliers so that suppliers will have to specify their emissions.  Excluding the after-hours move, Microsoft shares are up about 36% since the start of 2020, while the S&P 500 is up 5% over the same period.  WATCH: Microsoft partners with SpaceX to launch Azure Space—Here\'s what to know about the initiative', 'The coronavirus pandemic has crushed many industries but has favorably impacted work-at-home tech stocks due to the accelerated need for digitization and remote services and solutions during the crisis. The rapid shift to stay-at-home and learn-from-home trends coupled with a rise in internet usage has boosted demand for laptops, tablets and cloud services since the COVID-19 outbreak. Tech companies like Zoom Video, Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, DocuSign, and Fastly have benefited from pandemic-induced demand for many of their products and services.  Using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we will place tech giants Microsoft and Apple alongside each other to see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.  Microsoft (MSFT)  Microsoft has reinvented itself under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella and emerged as the second-largest cloud computing provider through its Azure platform lagging only Amazon (AMZN), which leads the market with its Amazon Web Services (AWS). Microsoft’s commercial cloud revenue surpassed the $50 billion mark for the first time in fiscal 2020 (ended June 30).  Microsoft’s market capitalization crossed the $1 trillion for the first time last year. The company has boosted its growth prospects through several strategic acquisitions, including LinkedIn in 2016 and GitHub in 2018.  Last month, Microsoft announced that it will acquire ZeniMax Media and its game publisher Bethesda Softworks for $7.5 billion. The deal will add Bethesda’s top gaming franchises like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout and will enhance the exclusive titles that will be available on Microsoft\'s Xbox Game Pass subscription service.  Microsoft believes that games are the primary growth engine fueling new cloud-gaming services like Xbox Game Pass as the gaming industry is transitioning from a device-centric to a player-centric platform. With the addition of Bethesda, the tech giant will have 23 creative studio teams up from 15.  Story continues  On Oct. 8, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $245 as he sees a potential tailwind for the company from the fiscal 2021 Xbox Series X and S console launches and from the purchase of Bethesda Softworks. The analyst also believes that the concerns about the console cycle adversely impacting gross margins ""may be inflated"" and that the overall gross margin expansion potential in fiscal 2021 remains underappreciated.  Weiss sees a potential $80 billion valuation for Microsoft\'s gaming subscription business alone. (See MSFT stock analysis on TipRanks)  Meanwhile, in July Microsoft reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended Jun. 30). The company’s fiscal 4Q revenue grew 12.8% Y/Y to $38 billion while EPS declined 14.6% to $1.46 mainly due to the impact of a $450 million charge related to the closure of retail stores.  Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes segment (includes Office 365, Microsoft 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics business solutions) increased 6% to $11.8 billion. However, the company noted that a weak job market hurt LinkedIn’s growth.  Intelligent Cloud segment’s (comprises server products and cloud services, including Azure, and enterprise services) revenue grew 17% to $13.4 billion with Azure revenue growing 47%. Although, it is notable that Azure growth decelerated from 59% in fiscal 3Q reflecting the impact of intense competition in the cloud market.  Revenue from the More Personal Computing segment (includes Windows, gaming revenue, sales from devices like Surface and revenue from Bing and Microsoft Advertising) rose 14% to $12.9 billion. The pandemic impacted Microsoft’s advertising revenue in fiscal 4Q as businesses cut back their marketing spending.  Looking ahead, the company anticipates its fiscal 2021 1Q revenue to benefit from demand for its cloud services and gaming revenue while it expects weakness in demand from small to medium businesses to be a drag on its transactional sales.  The Street has a bullish outlook for Microsoft with a Strong Buy consensus based on 24 Buys versus 3 Holds and no Sells. The stock has surged about 37% year-to-date and the average analyst price target of $230.92 indicates potential upside of 7% in the coming months.  Apple (AAPL)  Apple’s focus on innovation helped the company establish itself as one of the most valuable global brands. It was the first publicly traded US firm to hit $1 trillion market capitalization and the $2 trillion level as well. The company’s game-changing innovations over the years include the iPod, iPad and of course iPhone, which represents the largest revenue stream for the company.  The iPhone maker\'s loyal customers are eagerly awaiting the launch of 5G-enabled iPhone 12 smartphones. Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Kathryn Huberty reiterated a Buy rating for Apple as she sees the upcoming iPhone launch event on Oct. 13 as a catalyst to drive shares towards her price target of $130 (11% upside potential).  ""Our detailed iPhone mix and pricing analysis suggests FY21 Street unit and ASP [Average Selling Price] estimates remain too low,"" Huberty wrote in a note to investors. The analyst raised her fiscal 2021 iPhone shipment estimate to 220 million units from 218 million units and also increased the company’s fiscal 2021 revenue and EPS estimates by 2%. (See AAPL stock analysis on TipRanks)  iPhone sales accounted for 44% of the overall revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended Jun. 27). However, it is the services and wearables businesses where strong growth prospects are expected. These businesses are helping in offsetting the slowdown in iPhone revenue growth as competition from lower-priced smartphones is increasing. Also, the company’s services business carries a higher margin compared to other businesses.  In fiscal 3Q, Apple’s overall revenue grew about 11% Y/Y to $59.7 billion as the company experienced strong sales for its Macs and iPads amid the pandemic. The company reported growth across all other segments despite the impact of COVID-related store closures. iPhone revenue grew 1.7% to $26.4 billion. Overall, EPS was up 18% to $2.58 in fiscal 3Q.  Revenue from the Wearables, Home and Accessories category (includes AirPods, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Beats products, and other products and accessories) rose about 17% to $6.45 billion in 3Q. Services business, which includes revenue from the digital content stores, advertising, AppleCare and Apple TV+, grew 15% to $13.2 billion and accounted for 22% of overall revenue.  The Street is cautiously optimistic on Apple stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus breaks down into 24 Buys, 8 Holds and 3 Sells. Shares have surged 59.4% so far in 2020 with the average analyst price target of $122.06 suggesting a modest upside potential of 4.4% from current levels.  Conclusion  Both Microsoft and Apple are investing in key growth markets and have strong long-term growth potential. Microsoft has a dividend yield of 1% compared to Apple’s 0.70%. Last month, Microsoft announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.56 while Apple hiked its dividend by 6.5% to $0.82.  To summarize, a higher dividend yield, greater upside potential and the Street’s more bullish stance based on strong growth prospects in cloud services and gaming make Microsoft a better pick currently compared to Apple.

It is very important to do your own analysis before making any investment  More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:', ""Investors left GameStop (GME -0.34%) for dead in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, shares of the gaming retail specialist have sparkled in recent months, rallying from a 52-week low of $2.57 to around $10 by the end of September.  GameStop stock then soared 44% last Thursday , after the company announced a new partnership with Microsoft (MSFT 2.39%). The shares have roughly doubled year to date.  It wasn't entirely clear why the Microsoft announcement drove such a furious rally in GameStop stock, as the partnership mainly consists of GameStop adopting various Microsoft technology solutions. Yet even before last week, the stock price had become detached from GameStop's rather poor fundamentals.  GameStop's business has collapsed  GameStop's financial results have been deteriorating for several years because of a combination of cyclical and secular factors. A lack of new Sony and Microsoft consoles and weak game release slates have weighed on sales. On top of that, GameStop has been hurt by falling retail traffic and growing consumer adoption of game downloads (which allow game publishers and console makers to avoid retail middlemen like GameStop).  What started as moderate sales and earnings pressure turned into a rout last year, as consumers began to delay purchases ahead of the expected late-2020 releases of new PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles. Comparable sales plunged 19.6% in fiscal 2019, with big declines in both hardware and software. As a result, adjusted net income cratered 91% year over year to $19.1 million.  The pandemic made a bad situation worse. Sales plunged 34% in the first quarter and 27% in the second quarter. That led to an adjusted net loss of $195.1 million ($3.01 per share) for the first half of fiscal 2020.  Management tried to accentuate the positive, pointing to an 800% surge in e-commerce sales last quarter and solidly positive free cash flow. However, the e-commerce growth came off an extremely low base, and GameStop's total sales still plunged. Furthermore, the positive free cash flow was driven by a 50% year-over-year reduction in inventory: something that can't be repeated.  The Microsoft deal is overblown  As bad as GameStop's results have been in 2020, they still managed to get investors more excited about GameStop stock. The Microsoft announcement last week was the icing on the cake.  Yet as many retail analysts noted, the deal mainly consists of GameStop buying Microsoft technology. Employees will be equipped with Surface tablets and will begin using Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Teams. Buying some technology solutions hardly amounts to a legitimate positive catalyst.  The one substantive way in which the two companies are partnering is that GameStop will begin selling Xbox All Access. This is a bundle of a console and a 24-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate -- which provides access to over 100 games, along with other perks -- for no upfront cost. GameStop will get a share of the customer's monthly payments toward the console and the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate service. Essentially, it will be selling the subscription on commission.  It's certainly a good thing that GameStop will get a share of the revenue from this subscription offering. But once someone pays for subscription access to over 100 games, it's reasonable to expect that customer to buy fewer physical games in the future. Thus, GameStop is probably cannibalizing its own future sales.  GameStop has no future  While the upcoming PlayStation and Xbox console launches will help GameStop, the pandemic will almost certainly reduce the retailer's near-term share of console and game sales. In fact, analysts expect GameStop to run around breakeven in fiscal 2021 -- which ought to be a cyclically strong year -- with sales volumes well below the retailer's weak 2019 results.  Meanwhile, book value no longer provides a margin of safety for shareholders. Entering this year, GameStop stock traded at a 59% discount to book value. Now, the stock trades for more than twice the company's book value.  GameStop has been a business in decline for years. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process, such that the company may only break even or post small profits in good years while suffering huge losses in bad years. The company has plenty of cash, so bankruptcy isn't a near-term risk, but it's not clear how more time could enable GameStop to turn itself around. The recent surge in GameStop stock looks like a bubble that's bound to pop sooner or later.""]","[""Amazon AMZN is scheduled to report third-quarter 2020 results on Oct 29.    For third quarter, the company expects net sales between $87 billion and $93 billion. The figure is anticipated to improve in the range of 24-33% on a year-over-year basis.    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter net sales is pegged at $92.8 billion, suggesting growth of 32.7% from the prior-year quarter.    Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings currently stands at $7.27 per share, up 0.3% over the past 30 days. However, the figure suggests an improvement of of 71.9% from the year-ago reported figure.    The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 132.03%, on average.  Prime, Retail Efforts & E-commerce Demand: Key Factors to Note  Amazon’s strengthening distribution network and Prime-enabled fast delivery services are expected to have aided the performance of its e-commerce business in the to-be-reported quarter.    Prime Free One Day service, Amazon Fresh, and robust two-hour delivery service of natural and organic products such as meat and seafood, fresh produce, and staples from the Whole Foods Market are expected to have driven customer momentum in the quarter under review.    Further,theimpacts ofAmazon’s aggressive stance on the core retail industry, especially grocery retail, is expected to get reflected in its third-quarter results.    The opening of Amazon Fresh grocery store, which marks the company’s new grocery store, and the first Amazon Fresh supermarket remained have been positives. These are expected to have contributed well to the company’s grocery sales in the to-be-reported quarter.    Along with in-store shopping, the option of online shopping at the Amazon Fresh supermarket, which offers same-day delivery as well as grocery pick-up service pertaining to customers’ orders, is likely to have driven growth in the company’s online grocery orders.    Furthermore, Amazon extended ties with Morrisons in the third quarter in a bid to make the latter’s full range available to Prime members on Amazon.co.uk. This is anticipated to have bolstered the company’s grocery drive in the U.K. in the quarter under review.    Apart from grocery retail, the company’s deepening focus toward the fashion business is expected to get reflected in its third-quarter results.    In the to-be-reported quarter, Amazon introduced a shopping experience called Luxury Stores on its e-commerce app in an attempt to offer various luxury fashion and beauty brands. This is expected to have been beneficial for the company in delivering a better shopping experience to customers in the quarter under review.    All these endeavors are likely to have strengthened Amazon’s competitive edge against retailers like Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Kroger KR in the to-be-reported quarter.    Additionally, Amazon has been witnessing increasing shopping orders during the ongoing pandemic, thanks to the fact that online retail has become an integral part of the new normal. This, in turn, is likely to have driven its top-line growth significantly.    Moreover, this is expected to have helped the stock in gaining investor optimism during the to-be-reported quarter.    Apart from the Prime-based retail benefits, expanding original content and the overall content portfolio on Prime Video are expected to have driven the Prime subscription in the to-be-reported quarter.  Story continues  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote  Strengthening AWS Services  The impacts of the company’s expanding Amazon Web Services (AWS) portfolio are expected to get reflected in the third-quarter results.    In the third quarter, AWS made io2 for Amazon Elastic Block Store generally available. io2 is an advanced provisioned input/output operations per second SSD volume, which expands volume offerings of Amazon EBS that already provides four different types of volumes.    Further, AWS announced the general availability of Amazon Braket, which is a fully-managed service that allows customers to test and troubleshoot quantum algorithms on quantum computer simulators.    Furthermore, AWS Wavelength on Verizon’s 5G network was recently made generally available for users in Boston and San Francisco Bay Area.    Additionally, AWS made Contact Lens for Amazon Connect, Amazon Timestream, Amazon Fraud Detector, AWS IoT SiteWise and Amazon Interactive Video Servicegenerally available.    We expect all these initiatives to have helped Amazon in winning customers. This, in turn, is expected to have driven AWS’sthird-quarter revenues.  Expanding Smart Devices Portfolio  During third-quarter 2020, Amazon rolled out the next-generation Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite, which is an all-new device, in order to bolster its streaming devices offerings.    Further, the company unveiled the mesh Wi-Fi systems, namely eero Pro 6 and eero 6, in a bid to expand its Wi-Fi devices offerings.    Also, the company expanded its smart home security camera offerings by introducing Blink Outdoor and Blink Indoor wireless cameras.    Additionally, the launch of the all-new Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Dot with clock, Echo Dot Kids Edition, and Echo Show 10 strengthened its smart speaker offerings.    Furthermore, Amazon made its foray into the promising fitness tracker and wearable market by launching Amazon Halo and Amazon Halo Band, the fitness tracking service and wearable, respectively.    We believe that the impacts of these product launches are expected to get reflected in the company’sthird-quarter result.    Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Zacks Investment Research"", ""The sale of all sales is right around the corner: Amazon's (AMZN 3.54%) Prime Day will take place on Oct. 13-14. Past events have taken place in July, but this year the online retailing giant delayed the sale as it dealt with overwhelming demand brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  Last year, Prime Day sales exceeded Amazon's Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales combined as members purchased more than 175 million items globally. Amazon doesn't release sales figures, but according to Statista, Prime Day revenue totaled $7.16 billion in 2019.  If this year's event is as successful, will Amazon shares return to all-time-high levels reached in August? And if so, should you beat the rush and buy Amazon stock right now? Let's take a closer look and see if there's a good answer.  Net income doubles  While retailers that rely on in-store shopping have suffered in 2020, Amazon's sales have soared. Consumers, following stay-at-home orders, have turned to e-commerce to meet their shopping needs and, in some cases, stockpile essentials. In the first quarter, Amazon's sales climbed 26% year over year to $75.5 billion. In the second quarter, sales jumped 40% to $88.9 billion and net income doubled to $5.2 billion compared to the year-earlier period.  The Selligent Global Connected Consumer Index report shows that 36% of consumers these days are shopping online weekly compared with 28% prior to the coronavirus outbreak.  And e-commerce gains aren't likely to stop any time soon. The health crisis continues and many consumers are still trying to avoid crowds. With the holiday season approaching, shopping for gifts will be on the minds of many as well. These factors suggest Amazon is heading into Prime Day in a position of strength.  The challenge Amazon faces is whether its logistics team will be able to handle the order volume and fullfill its two-day delivery promises to Prime users? During the coronavirus outbreak, the company has struggled with delivery demands. In March and April, Amazon hired 175,000 people in fulfillment and delivery to address the issue. Last month, the retailer said it plans to hire 100,000 additional people for operations network roles in the U.S. and Canada. Amazon has also opened more than 75 new fulfillment and other related centers in the two countries this year and just last month opened 100 buildings across its sites.  A big victory is at stake  Amazon is hoping its recent hiring and logistics ramp-up will help it successfully manage Prime Day demand. Doing so also means likely new Prime members, who signed up to benefit from the sale, will stick around after their trial membership ends. But troubles and issues could result in just the opposite. Still, I think Amazon learned from its early coronavirus experience and has developed an appropriate logistics scale-up. That belief has me optimistic about Amazon's Prime Day prospects.  How big could Prime Day be for Amazon? The event is projected to generate $9.91 billion globally, up 43% from last year, according to a forecast from eMarketer. That's nearly 9% of the company's total second-quarter sales figure, projected to come from sales made in only two days. Last year, Amazon devices such as the Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick were top-selling items. This year, Amazon promises up to $80 off on some of its devices, 30% to 50% off on household items, up to 40% off many toys, and other deals across product categories. Even the grocery segment will offer savings, with 30% off Hershey's Halloween candy, for example.  But should you buy Amazon stock?  So, does this mean your first Prime Day purchase should be Amazon shares? Yes and no. Solid Prime Day performance will likely boost Amazon shares. So, in the short term, investors will benefit. But if you buy Amazon shares in a few weeks or months instead of now, you won't have lost out. Investors will benefit even more from Amazon over the long term. Annual earnings and revenue have been rising over the past several years and have really taken off as of 2018.  Online shopping was gaining ground before the coronavirus outbreak. Last year, global online sales rose 19% to $3.53 trillion from the previous year, a Statista report shows. Now, with the consumer's new online shopping routine and new perspective on in-store visits, I expect e-commerce to remain popular even post-coronavirus.  All of this means Amazon stock makes a great pre-Prime Day deal and a solid long-term stock to buy down the road -- even at a higher price."", 'Amazon reported better-than-expected third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, including soaring profits and 37% revenue growth.  The stock bounced around in extended trading, falling as much as 2%, after Amazon provided a wide guidance range for the fourth quarter.  Earnings: $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv  $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv Revenue: $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv  Amazon said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121 billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion.  The company forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That\'s a step up from last quarter, when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on coronavirus-related measures.  Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that the largest portion of these costs stem from ""continued productivity headwinds"" in its warehouses, including enforcing social distancing rules, extended breaks for workers and other steps ""to make sure our people are safe and distanced."" The costs also include investments in enhanced cleaning and building out testing capabilities.  ""There\'s productivity drags for things like new hire ramps, social distancing, any break periods, things that we can quantify,"" Olsavsky said. ""This is a change in our process that has hurt productivity.""  Still, Amazon continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as consumers flock to the site for essential goods, groceries and household items. The cost of shipping those goods to customers rose during the third quarter, with expenses up 57% from a year earlier to $15.1 billion.  Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.  ""We\'re seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts, which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented holiday season,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.']","[""It has been a blowout year for Nvidia (NVDA). The chip giant’s relentless forward march has been boosted by strong macro driven performances from its two main breadwinners – gaming and data center – and an increasing focus on rising secular trends, including autonomous vehicle technology and artificial intelligence (AI).  It also completed the takeover of data specialist Mellanox and, pending regulatory approval, has the $40 billion acquisition of UK-based chip designer ARM lined up next.  It is the latter’s anticipated addition, along with its implications on Nvidia’s growing AI opportunity, which has Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill laying out the bull case for Nvidia.  Gill has a Buy rating on NVDA shares accompanied by a Street high price target of $700. Upside from current levels is a healthy 26%. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)  Nvidia is currently hosting its week-long virtual GTC conference, and has already revealed a string of new developments, including a partnership with Glaxo Smith Kline’s AI lab to discover new medicines and vaccines, its intention to build the most powerful supercomputer in the U.K. with a focus on healthcare AI research, deep learning-based models used by AMEX to prevent fraud, and AI driven software to reduce the amount of data used in video calls.  It has also brought Nvidia’s increasing reliance on ARM into sharp focus with the announcement of a new type of processor called a Data Processing Unit (DPU).  The Blue field-2 DPU combines 8 64-bit A72 Arm cores and Mellanox ConnectX-6 NIC. The cutting-edge data-center-on a chip is designed to unburden critical networking, storage, and security duties from CPUs.  Gill notes that with the new processors in tow, Nvidia's data center TAM (total addressable market) will be increased from $50 billion to $100 billion by 2024.  The analyst expects AI to “inevitably change every aspect of business and life,” and further said, “We believe NVDA is at the forefront of this trend with its vast hardware and software portfolio. With the acquisition of Arm, we believe NVDA becomes ubiquitous in the semiconductor industry, as it will offer all three processors (CPU, GPU, NPU) to address the AI revolution. We believe the earnings multiple is justified by climbing demand for cloud storage, both at hyperscaler and enterprise/verticals customers, driven by the stay-at-home economy.”  Story continues  Gill might be Wall Street’s most prominent Nvidia bull, but the GPU giant hardly lacks support elsewhere. NVDA's Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 26 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell. However, considering shares have already appreciated by 135% year-to-date, the analysts anticipate the stock to stay range-bound for the foreseeable future, as the $571.19 average price target indicates.

Just like that, as COVID cases rise in the United States and Europe and some government restrictions are back in place, the bulls have taken their gains off the table and moved to the sidelines.  Even the hottest industry, the semiconductors, is down about 5% over the last 5 sessions.  With some of the hot growth stocks seeing a pullback, maybe it’s time to put together a wish list of great companies that could get cheaper in the next few weeks?  They’re Not Cheap  No one would argue that any of these hot growth stocks are cheap. Nor are they values on the classic valuation method of P/E or price-to-book ratios.  But all five of these stocks are off their recent highs.  Why not buy stocks on sale?  5 Hot Growth Stocks for Your Wish List  1. Advanced Micro Devices AMD is up 66% year-to-date but it has fallen 6% over the last 5 sessions even after it reported strong earnings and announced it was buying Xilinx. Yes, it trades with a forward P/E of 71 but a further sell-off means the stock is on sale.  2. NVIDIA NVDA has been nearly untouchable for value investors since its spring coronavirus sell-off lows. Shares are up 114% year-to-date and it’s now trading at 58x forward earnings. But over the last 5 sessions it’s fallen 5.5%.  3. Wingstop WING has been one of the best performing publicly traded restaurant chains in 2020. For the second quarter, same-store-sales jumped 31.9% but it kept that momentum even after the lockdowns ended, adding same-store-sales comps of 25.4% in the third quarter. Not surprising, given the execution, shares were up 95% year-to-date over the summer, and hitting new highs. But they’ve retreated in recent months and are now down 9% over the last month. Should value investors be poking around?  Story continues  4. Domino’s DPZ has also been a hot restaurant pandemic play. It’s app and delivery capabilities has translated into stellar same-store-sales, with third quarter US sales jumping another 17.5%. It hasn’t pulled back as much as some of the others, only losing 2% in the last 5 sessions. But if it pulls back further, is it a buying opportunity?  5. Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG launched its loyalty program, and grab and go capabilities, at exactly the right time. It’s also been one of the big pandemic winners but shares are the most expensive they’ve been in years, with a forward P/E of 119. Still, shares have lost 7.7% over the last 5 sessions. Should you buy Chipotle if you can get it on sale?  There are dozens of other companies that value investors could also have on their wish lists.

GOOGL is scheduled to report third-quarter 2020 results on Oct 29. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 20.17%.    The stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 3.97%.    For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $11.30 per share, implying growth of 11.7% from the year-ago reported figure.    The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $35.26 billion, implying growth of 6.8% from the year-ago reported figure.  Performance in the Last Reported Quarter  Alphabet reported second-quarter 2020 non-GAAP earnings of $10.13 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.43. Earnings increased 2.6% sequentially but decreased 28.7% year over year.    Revenues of $31.60 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3% driven by strength in the company’s cloud and YouTube businesses.    Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.  Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alphabet Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alphabet Inc. Quote  E-commerce, Cloud Momentum & Other Key Catalysts  Markedly, Google has been making strong efforts to reinforce presence in the e-commerce world as e-commerce has been witnessing an unprecedented spike buoyed by the COVID-19 pandemic.    Also, the company drove momentum across the advertising business with new features that include booking for services using Local Services ads by Google that is known for connecting customers to trustworthy service providers, Local Opportunity Finder, local store information, smart campaigns and Grow My Store for retailers.    In addition, Google has been significantly gaining momentum in the highly-competitive cloud market over the last few quarters. During the third quarter, it expanded the cloud service portfolio and data centers.    In this regard, Google Cloud invested $100 million in Amwell — a telehealth company that enables seamless virtual doctor visits.    Per the deal, the company will shift parts of the business that are currently loaded on Amazon’s AWS to Google Cloud.    The deal is expected to have bolstered Google’s cloud customer base and aided the performance of the cloud division that has become an integral part of the overall business.    Also, during the quarter, the company announced plans to invest a huge amount to build new data centers, which should add efficiency to Google’s business.    The positive impact of these efforts is likely to reflect on the upcoming results.  Story continues  Waymo Efforts  The company’s self-driving project, Waymo, has been steadily gaining momentum in the autonomous vehicle market.    Also, the Latent Logic acquisition strengthened Alphabet’s presence in the booming self-driving vehicles market of Europe and U.K. This deal is expected to have helped the company expand user reach in the self-driving space.    These efforts are likely to have driven Alphabet’s top-line growth in the quarter under review.  Other Initiatives  During the quarter, Google renamed its G Suite — a package of online business tools namely Gmail, Drive, Docs and Meet — as Google Workspace. Customers who utilize Gmail, Google Doc and other tools free of cost will get access to these new features in the coming months.    Also, Google added a new feature to Google Maps in order to help users travel safely amid the ongoing pandemic by identifying COVID-19 hot zones. The new feature, COVID-19 layer button menu, is available on the map. This button enables a user to know the spread of the virus in a particular area.    In addition, Google teamed up with Apple to develop push notifications for iOS and Android users for contact tracing and curbing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic by building more of the necessary technology directly into phones. The newly launched Exposure Notification System is designed to automatically alert people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.    The latest efforts are expected to have strengthened Google’s key offerings to individual and enterprise customers, thereby expanding top-line growth.  Concerns  Alphabet’s search advertising business has been facing stiff competition from Amazon. Google Cloud has been trailing both Amazon and Microsoft MSFT in the cloud computing space. Increasing competition in both the markets might have hurt its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.    In addition, increased spending on consumer gadgets, YouTube video app and cloud computing services is anticipated to have been a risk. Higher expenses are expected to get reflected in the company’s upcoming results.  Earnings Whispers  Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Alphabet this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. And that is the case here.

Zacks Investment Research"", 'Google parent company Alphabet \'s stock rose as much as 9% in after-hours trading as it crushed expectations for both earnings and revenue in its third-quarter earnings results, showing strong growth in advertising revenue across the board.  The company beat estimates across the board, following its first-ever revenue decline in Q2. The results showed a strong rebound in its core advertising business, which was hit hard by customer spending pullbacks amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It follows similarly strong earnings reports by ad-driven online companies Pinterest and Snap earlier this month.  For the quarter ending September 30, the company brought in total advertising revenue of $37.10 billion, compared to $33.80 billion a year ago. YouTube ad growth was particularly strong, up 32% from a year ago. Fears of a search advertising crunch did not materialize, as the company\'s ""Search and Other"" advertising category showed 6% growth from a year ago.  On the company\'s earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said, ""This year, including this quarter, showed how valuable Google\'s founding product, search, has been to people.""  Pichai said starting next quarter, it will report operating income for its cloud business, joining Amazon in giving investors more details.  ""Starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2020, we\'ll break out Google Cloud as a separate reporting segment,"" Pichai said. ""With the segmentation, you will additionally see information about the scale of our investment, which will help gauge the progress we are making on the multi-year path ahead to create sustainable value.""  Executives said YouTube has over 30 million music and premium paid subscribers and YouTube TV has more than 3 million subscribers. YouTube views for guided meditation videos are up 40% since mid-March, Porat said. Tutorials on how to make face masks have been viewed over one billion times.  Google\'s ""Other Revenue,"" which includes hardware like its Pixel phones, came in at $5.48 billion, compared to $4.05 billion a year ago. The rise was a result of Google Play engagement during the pandemic, CFO Ruth Porat said. ""There are signs that user behavior is beginning to return to normalized levels,"" she added on the earnings call.  Alphabet said its revenue from ""Other Bets,"" which includes its subsidiaries outside of Google like the self-driving car company Waymo and Life Sciences business Verily brought in $178 million compared to $155 million a year ago. Meanwhile, Other Bets showed an operating loss of $1.10 billion, up from $941 million a year ago.  Pichai briefly commented on the recent Department of Justice lawsuit, which alleged Google holds monopolistic power in the search market.  ""Regarding the DoJ\'s lawsuit, we believe that our products are creating significant benefits and we\'ll confidently make our case,"" Pichai said. ""Our company\'s focus remains on continuing our work to build a Search product that people love and value.""  Correction: YouTube advertising revenues were $5.04 billion for the quarter, and TAC was $8.17 billion.', ""It's a debate nearly as old as the stock market itself: Growth versus value.  A 2016 analysis by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch gives the nod to value stocks, although both types of stocks have performed exceptionally well. Between 1926 and 2015, BofA found that value stocks outperformed growth stocks on an annual average basis (17% vs. 12.6%).  However, growth stocks have wildly outperformed value stocks since the Great Recession. This is likely in part due to historically low lending rates fueling borrowing, hiring, acquisitions, and innovation. With interest rates likely to remain well below their historical average throughout the 2020s, growth stocks could be a smart place to park your money over the next decade.  The following four growth stocks represent rock-solid companies that I believe you can safely hold through 2030.  Facebook  In the past few months, social media giant Facebook (META 4.10%) faced advertising boycotts over its hate-speech oversight, as well as a recent report from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law that accused it of holding monopoly power.  This is par for the course when you're the most dominant social media platform.  Facebook ended June with 2.7 billion monthly active users (MAU), or 3.14 billion MAUs if you include family sites like Instagram and WhatsApp. Advertisers are aware that there's no other social platform they can go to where they're going to reach up to 3 billion targeted pairs of eyeballs. This is what gives Facebook such incredible and lasting pricing power on its ads.  Facebook is arguably still in the early to middle innings of its growth phase. While that might be hard to believe for a company already valued at $753 billion, Facebook hasn't yet monetized Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp in any meaningful way. Facebook owns four of the six most widely used social platforms in the world, but has only truly monetized two of them. This suggests Facebook's growth runway should extend throughout the 2020s.  Intuitive Surgical  Precision medicine is going to be the single greatest growth driver in the healthcare space over the next decade, and I have no doubt in my mind that surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 2.44%) will benefit big time from it.  Intuitive Surgical is the company behind the da Vinci surgical system, which is used in a variety of soft tissue surgeries to make smaller and more precise incisions that heal more quickly, shortening hospital stays.  Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci system is the undisputed leader in robotic-assisted surgical procedures. The company had more than 5,700 of its machines installed worldwide as of June 2020, which is more than any of its competitors on a combined basis. Its competitive advantage appears safe.  Furthermore, investors should fully expect Intuitive Surgical's bottom-line expansion to outpace sales growth throughout the decade. Selling procedure-specific instruments and maintenance services generates much juicier margins for the company than the da Vinci systems themselves, which are costly to build. As the company's installed base expands, we can expect a growing percentage of total sales to derive from these higher-margin segments.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Usually, novel drugmakers in the biotech space wouldn't be considered safe haven investments over a full decade. After all, brand-name drugs have finite periods of patent exclusivity that threaten their long-term cash flow potential. But Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 1.86%) looks to be an exception to the rule.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals is the leading drug developer for patients with cystic fibrosis. CF is a hereditary disease that produces thick mucus that can obstruct a patients' lungs and pancreas. Though there's no cure, Vertex's products for specific CF mutations are improving the lives of patients.  The company's newest approved CF drug, Trikafta, led to a 3.7-percentage-point improvement relative to a placebo in an airway obstruction metric often used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. It also met all of its secondary endpoints in a late-stage trial. Perhaps it's no surprise that the Food and Drug Administration gave it the green light five months ahead of schedule -- or that, after two full quarters on pharmacy shelves, Trikafta has already achieved blockbuster status (i.e., greater than $1 billion in annual sales).  Vertex's innovation and focus on specific CF mutations will protect its cash flow and allow for double-digit growth potential through at least 2030.  Alphabet  Even though it's been hit harder than other FAANG stocks during the coronavirus recession, Alphabet (GOOGL 1.20%) (GOOG 1.08%) is a growth stock investors can safely buy and hang onto through 2030, if not well beyond.  Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the most dominant Internet search platform in the world. According to data from StatCounter Global Stats, Google has maintained between 91.9% and 93% of global search market share over the trailing year. Just as Facebook is the unquestioned go-to for social media advertising, Google is the clear leader for search-based ad placement, and that's not going to change anytime soon.  However, Alphabet is more than just search these days. YouTube has become one of the three most visited social websites in the world, driving the company's ad growth. We're also witnessing exceptionally fast growth from cloud infrastructure segment Google Cloud, which topped $3 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time during the pandemic-challenged second quarter. The high margins generated from Google Cloud should allow Alphabet's cash flow to catapult higher by mid-decade.""]","['Worm Capital recently released its Q3 2020 Investor Letter, a copy of which you can download here.

Here is what Worm Capital said:  ""A good example of riding our winners this year is Tesla, which we have studied down to the cellchemistry level since 2015. In August, for instance, the bid for Tesla increased some 70%. Was this increase in bid itself a reason to sell our ownership, or even to trim? No. Tesla continues to be dramatically undervalued relative to its long-term, multi-year intrinsic value, in our view. As I have discussed in previous letters, I believe Tesla is perhaps the single best investment opportunity in the market today: It is a true disruptor competing in vast end markets (transportation, trucking, energy storage) that are each worth trillions of dollars of potential market cap. By 2025, I expect Tesla to be trading at multiples of where it’s currently priced today. Of course, month-to-month or even quarter-to-quarter we may see the prices bounce around, but we don’t attempt to time the market. As a rule, industry juggernauts in their early stages tend to be more volatile.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.', 'This article is part of Fortune‘s quarterly investment guide for Q4 2020.    For years it has been a little-talked about secret hiding in plain sight: Tesla doesn’t make much of its money selling cars. Instead, the company has shrewdly capitalized on mastering a complex market for selling global emissions credits. As Fortune previously examined in detail, Tesla’s credit sales started off small, averaging $3.4 million per year through 2011, and rising to $1.049 billion through the last four quarters ended June 30, 2020.  To sum it up, Tesla amasses tradable credits from four main sources. The first category is zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) programs run by the states, notably California. It also benefits from two U.S. federal standards, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, and corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) rules established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The fourth is the European Union’s CO2 emissions targets.  CAFE was born during the oil crisis of 1978 and sets annual average miles per gallon standards that a manufacturer must meet for its entire fleet. GHG arose from a 2007 Supreme Court decision that designated CO2 as a pollutant, and hence gave the EPA authority to regulate vehicles. GHG establishes a limit for the amount of CO2 per vehicle a manufacturer’s fleet can emit before triggering penalties. Both programs, which closely coordinate their regulations, required that automakers start complying in 2012. That same year, they also began awarding ZEV-like credits to manufacturers that exceeded the benchmarks.  Under both programs, Tesla earns maximum credits for every car it produces, since its vehicles neither consume gasoline nor spew CO2. In fact, the credits it receives rise smoothly with production. Its customers’ need for credits rises in parallel as they make more noncompliant trucks and SUVs. Since Tesla’s credits and its customers’ deficits run in tandem, Tesla trades its CAFE and GHG credits on long-term contracts that produce more consistent, though in the past smaller, revenue than the inflow from lumpy ZEV sales.  Under President Obama, the CAFE and GHG rules got a lot stricter, mandating 5% annual increases in fuel economy and a like decline in grams of CO2. But the Trump administration rolled back the requirements to yearly improvements of just 1.5%. If it remains in effect, that downshift means that most carmakers posting shortfalls won’t need to increase their purchases of credits in the future, and may buy fewer of them.  “This is totally different from California, which is like a different country,” says Ben Leard, an environmental economist and an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee. “The Obama rules were putting a lot of pressure on carmakers to buy more credits.” That pressure is expected to ease in the years ahead, given the rollback in standards. As a result, he predicts that the price of credits, and possibly the volumes sold, will decrease in 2021 and the years ahead.  If the current rules hold, Tesla is likely to see its CAFE and GHG revenues fall going forward. The decline should should be gradual, in contrast to ZEV, which should see a spike followed by a steep slide starting in a couple of years.  But a new administration could flip that script. If President Biden were to restore the aggressive targets, it would be a huge boost CAFE and GHG sales. In his “Plan for Climate Change and Environmental Justice,” Biden cites his pride in raising the CAFE mileage requirements during the Obama administration, implying that he’d push to revive or even tighten those standards as President. To do so, he’d need a buy-in from the auto companies that initially agreed to the Obama rules before convincing Trump to roll them back. If he doesn’t get carmakers to agree, he’d likely need to resort to legislation. And toughening the GHG rules requires amending the Clean Air Act. So if Biden wins the presidency in a blue sweep, keeps the House majority and wins the Senate, automakers will probably be forced to buy a lot more of Tesla’s credits to skirt big fines. That’s only a short-term benefit, however. The stricter regime will also force the manufacturers to accelerate their move to electric cars.  Meanwhile in Europe, the glory days of selling carbon credits may already be numbered. There, Tesla’s biggest buyer of credits has been FCA, maker of Jeep, Fiat, Maserati, and Alfa Romeo. But FCA plans to launch a number of hybrids, plug-ins, and EVs from 2020 to 2022, including new versions of the Jeep Renegade SUV, as well as the new all-electric version of the Fiat 500. FCA’s leaders have stated publicly that they expect the automaker to be compliant with the new rules on its own by 2022, implying that it will no longer need Tesla. At the end of 2019, FCA agreed to merge with the much greener Peugeot, a deal expected to close next year. That union could bring FCA in line still earlier.  But even an environmentalist in the White House will only buy Tesla some time, rather than preserve its current flood of profits. CAFE and GHG revenues will eventually succumb to the blow of increased competition: Starting around 2023 an influx of new EVs from manufacturers like Ford will bring their fleets closer to full compliance, reducing their purchases of Tesla credits relative to the past.  After that, it appears Tesla will have to reach profitability the old-fashioned way: by selling cars.

But while yesterday\'s run-up in share price was easily tracked back to an analyst talking up 3D stock, today\'s news is a bit more of a ""deep track.""  Today, it\'s news out of Tesla (TSLA 1.44%) that is pushing 3D Systems stock higher.  So what  Specifically, it\'s a job posting at Tesla in which the electric car maker advertises that it\'s looking to hire a ""highly motivated ... additive manufacturing technician ... to operate SLA/SLS/FDM 3D printing equipment in our rapidly growing Additive Manufacturing operations.""  Now, we\'ve known that Tesla was using 3D printing to produce car parts for years. What seems to be new in this announcement is that the company is ""rapidly growing"" its additive manufacturing operations, more commonly known as 3D printing.  Now what  How big a piece of Tesla\'s manufacturing 3D printing will become remains to be seen, but Elon Musk\'s comments about wanting to build cars with single-piece casting speaks to the company\'s desire to simplify the manufacturing process with fewer parts -- and 3D printing is an ideal way to help do that.  The big question now is whether more 3D printing at Tesla directly implies more purchases of 3D printers and 3D printing materials from 3D Systems, in particular.

Facebook has succeeded in getting a significant percentage of the world\'s population on its platform. However, that level of success naturally leads to questions as to whether investors can continue to friend this communication stock over the long term. Nonetheless, the company has moved into other tech niches that could ensure its growth for another five years, and perhaps beyond.  The coming growth crunch  Indeed, the near-term outlook for Facebook could bring an increasing number of likes. Although the company declined to give earnings guidance in its second-quarter 2020 report issued in late July, it believes year-over-year ad revenue will grow by about 10% in the upcoming quarter. Also, analysts expect profits to rise by 25% this year and by 27% in fiscal 2021. Facebook also maintains a base of 3.1 billion monthly active users, an increase of 12% over the last year.  Still, its current apps could face a significant growth limitation over the next five years that investors normally associate with companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald\'s. Facebook\'s current user base is about 40% of the world\'s population. Given that a large percentage of the unserved population does not have broadband access, Facebook could soon face global market saturation.  Where Facebook will find additional growth  Hence, for the next five years, the company will likely have to lean on additional platforms to maintain its current growth rate. For now, those platforms are Portal and Oculus.  Portal is Facebook\'s smart video hardware. It allows for video calls using WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger and has Amazon\'s Alexa built into its product. However, Amazon offers a similar product called Echo Show, so the growth prospects for Portal remain unclear.  Nonetheless, Facebook could bring a more profound change to the tech market through Oculus. Oculus is Facebook\'s virtual reality (VR) hardware, which will offer a simulated environment for users.  To Facebook\'s credit, it holds a competitive advantage with Oculus. Facebook technically lags Sony in the sale of VR headsets, according to technology market research provider TrendForce. However, Facebook sells untethered devices, while Sony ties its headsets to its PlayStation gaming console.  Moreover, high consumer demand for VR devices exists, and at $299, the new Oculus Quest 2 will sell for $100 less than its predecessor. Facebook will likely develop applications aimed at its massive user base, further widening its competitive advantage over prospective competitors.  For now, Facebook defines sales of Portal and Oculus as ""other revenue."" While the $366 million in other revenue made up only a small portion of Facebook\'s $18.7 billion in revenue in the second quarter, the category grew by 40% from year-ago levels. In percentage terms, this growth rate is far ahead of advertising, which expanded by 10% over the same period.  Furthermore, considering the anticipated growth, Facebook remains a reasonably priced stock. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 24, a modest multiple considering the profit growth predicted in the near term.  Facebook in five years  At its current valuation, Facebook is a clear buy. Looking five years ahead, investors who friend Facebook stock now should benefit from significant growth, especially if the company meets analyst profit-growth estimates.  However, investors should expect the company to have a different focus at that time. Instead of looking at ad revenue through rose-colored glasses, stockholders should put on an Oculus headset and prepare for a ride that is virtually assured to bring a more profitable reality. Even though VR products make up only a small percentage of revenue now, this category should continue to grow much faster than Facebook\'s ad revenue.  VR\'s power will not lie so much in hardware, which tends to become commoditized. Since Facebook now has over 3.1 billion users, VR will probably help it monetize its customer base, offering Facebook a competitive advantage over its peers.  Investors have already seen massive returns from Facebook\'s ability to connect people. Over time, the stock will probably move much higher as it makes VR-driven returns a reality.', 'Nio Inc – ADR (NYSE: NIO) shares have broken into record territory after an analyst at JPMorgan issued upbeat commentary on the overall Chinese new energy vehicle, or NEV, market.  The Nio Analyst: Nick Lai upgraded Nio\'s stock from Neutral to Overweight and increased the price target from $14 to $40.  Emerging and Structural Shift In Industry Trend: Penetration of Chinese NEVs that includes fuel cell, hybrid and battery vehicles is poised to increase from less than 5% in 2019 to 20% in 2025, Lai said in a note. This is premised on a shift in customers from ICE to EVs and expected production cost-parity between ICE and EV by 2022/23, as battery cost drops further.  China is witnessing ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" phenomenon, which is not only leading to a fast growing NEV addressable market but also benefitting suppliers relevant to the broader EV supply chain, Lai said.  JPMorgan\'s positive view on Nio is based on its bullish top-down sector view. The analyst estimates Nio will likely earn a 7% market share in the passenger EV market by 2025, or specifically a 30% share in the premium space the company focuses on.  Related Link: Nio\'s 4th Annual \'Nio Day\' Coming In January: What Investors Need To Know  Nio, being within the top 10 by market share, will benefit from the emerging and structural shift from ""B"" to ""C,"" as more EV buyers are individuals, rather than corporates or individuals living in cities with purchase quotas, the analyst said.  nio_2_0.png  The company also stands to gain from the extension of NEV subsidy program toward 2022, with battery swap business model being covered by government\'s subsidy, and a meaningful pick up in new model launches.  ""We come to the conclusion that Nio remains attractive from a long term perspective,"" Lai wrote in the note.  Upcoming Catalysts: Anticipated solid third-quarter results in mid-November. The analyst expects third-quarter gross profit margin to expand further from 8% in the second quarter to 12% in the third quarter.  Story continues  Robust order backlog, in particular, for the newly launched EC6 crossover model is another catalyst.  A new sedan model scheduled to debut on ""Nio Day"" should further enhance the company\'s current product portfolio.  NIO Price Action: Nio shares were rallying 9.99% to $23.78.

(TSE:TCN) since 2015, and this article will examine the executive's compensation with respect to the overall performance of the company. This analysis will also assess whether Tricon Residential pays its CEO appropriately, considering recent earnings growth and total shareholder returns.  Check out our latest analysis for Tricon Residential  Comparing Tricon Residential Inc.'s CEO Compensation With the industry  Our data indicates that Tricon Residential Inc. has a market capitalization of CA$2.1b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$5.2m for the year to December 2019. Notably, that's an increase of 65% over the year before. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$622k.  In comparison with other companies in the industry with market capitalizations ranging from CA$1.3b to CA$4.2b, the reported median CEO total compensation was US$5.2m. So it looks like Tricon Residential compensates Gary Berman in line with the median for the industry. Moreover, Gary Berman also holds CA$14m worth of Tricon Residential stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.  Component 2019 2018 Proportion (2019) Salary US$622k US$618k 12% Other US$4.5m US$2.5m 88% Total Compensation US$5.2m US$3.1m 100%  On an industry level, around 54% of total compensation represents salary and 46% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that Tricon Residential allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance.  A Look at Tricon Residential Inc.'s Growth Numbers  Tricon Residential Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 28% a year over the past three years. It achieved revenue growth of 171% over the last year.  Story continues  This demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. Most shareholders would be pleased to see strong revenue growth combined with EPS growth. This combo suggests a fast growing business. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.  Has Tricon Residential Inc. Been A Good Investment?  Tricon Residential Inc. has generated a total shareholder return of 12% over three years, so most shareholders would be reasonably content. But they would probably prefer not to see CEO compensation far in excess of the median.  In Summary...  As we noted earlier, Tricon Residential pays its CEO in line with similar-sized companies belonging to the same industry. But EPS growth over the last three years has been impressive, although the same cannot be said for shareholder returns. Considering overall performance, we'd say the compensation is fair, although stockholders will want to see higher returns moving forward.  We can learn a lot about a company by studying its CEO compensation trends, along with looking at other aspects of the business.

Zacks Investment Research']","['Texas-headquartered Oil and Gas company Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) announced plans on Monday to cut jobs across its affiliates in Europe. The country-specific impact of the layoffs is still uncertain, and the decision would be based entirely on the company’s presence in the local markets and the prevailing market conditions.  In the last six months, Exxon stock has dropped close to 17%, and approximately 52% on a year-to-date basis.  What Happened: Exxon’s plan to reduce staff is driven by cost competitiveness and it estimates up to 1,600 employees across Europe could face the ax by the end of next year. According to the Financial Times, this represents more than one-tenth of its total headcount in the European region.  In an earnings guidance shared last week, the company said it expected to post anywhere between a loss of 68 cents and a profit of 7 cents in the current quarter, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Why Does It Matter: The Oil and Gas sector has suffered a severe drop in demand since the pandemic outbreak and FT reported that petroleum producers have taken significant steps to cut costs.  Last week, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (NYSE: RDS-A) announced plans for a major business overhaul which could lead to 10% job cuts, according to Reuters. By the end of 2022, Shell might lay off 7,000 to 9,000 staff, which includes around 1,500 employees quitting voluntarily.  In June CNBC reported that the British oil company BP Plc (NYSE: BP) would layoff 10,000 employees by the end of the year i.e. approximately 15% of its workforce.

Chevron closed trading on Wednesday with a $142 billion market cap, eclipsing Exxon's $141.6 billion value. But both have fallen below renewable energy giant NextEra Energy (NEE -0.93%), which has surged to a $145.5 billion market value this year.  While Chevon is now the largest U.S. oil company, it's a fraction of its former self. At its peak in 2014, the company had a $256 billion market cap. Shares have since fallen more than 45% from their high, with most of that damage coming this year as they've declined 39% due to crashing crude prices caused by the coronavirus.  ExxonMobil is also a shell of a once-mighty oil giant. At its peak in 2007, it had a more than $500 billion market cap. It has since shed more than 70% of its value, including cratering 52% this year. Like Chevron, lower oil prices are a major factor.  But oil price volatility is only part of the story. Another significant driver is a shift in investor sentiment away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. Not only are renewables cleaner, but they're also growing faster due to the rapid decline in costs. That's allowing utilities like NextEra Energy to generate strong earnings growth while oil giants like Exxon and Chevron are seeing their profits erode as crude prices crumble.  That trend will likely become even more pronounced given the chilling demand forecast of fellow big-oil producer BP (BP -0.59%), which estimates that it could have already peaked. That's leading BP to join investors in pivoting toward renewables so that it's not left in the dust."", 'Exxon Mobil on Friday reported its third straight quarter of losses as depressed oil demand sparked by the coronavirus pandemic weighed on the company\'s operations.  During the third quarter, the company lost $680 million, although Exxon said results improved on a quarter-over-quarter basis thanks to ""early stages of demand recovery.""  On an adjusted basis, Exxon lost 18 cents per share during the quarter while generating $46.2 billion in revenue. The Street was expecting a 25 cent loss per share and $46.01 billion in revenue, according to estimates from Refinitiv.  A year earlier, the company earned 75 cents per share on $65.05 billion in revenue. During the second quarter of 2020, Exxon lost 70 cents per share on an adjusted basis, while revenue came in at $32.61 billion.  ""We remain confident in our long-term strategy and the fundamentals of our business, and are taking the necessary actions to preserve value while protecting the balance sheet and dividend,"" Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said. ""We are on pace to achieve our 2020 cost-reduction targets and are progressing additional savings next year as we manage through this unprecedented down cycle.""  Exxon previously announced a reduction in its capital spending program — from $33 billion to $23 billion — and the company said it\'s ahead of schedule due to increased efficiencies and a slower project pace, among other things. The company is targeting to spend $16 billion to $19 billion in its 2021 capital program.  Exxon also said Thursday it intends to reduce its U.S. staff by around 1,900 employees, with global workforce reductions potentially rising to as much as 15%. As of the end of 2019 Exxon had a global workforce of 88,300, including 13,300 contractors.  As oil and gas companies grapple with the ongoing demand loss from Covid-19, some companies have announced dividend reductions in an effort to slash costs.  Exxon has repeatedly said its dividend remains a priority, and on Wednesday the company maintained its fourth-quarter dividend at 87 cents per share. But it was the first time since 1982 that the company didn\'t raise its payout. The company currently yields 10.56%.  Research firm Edward Jones noted that there\'s an increasing risk that Exxon will have to cut its dividend in 2021 if demand doesn\'t fully recover.  It\'s been a difficult few months for Exxon. In August, the company was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Chevron recently surpassed Exxon for the first time to become the most valuable U.S. energy company based on market capitalization, although Exxon\'s current market valuation is higher.

This is the first time Chevron has been in the top spot since at least 1980, according to Bloomberg data.  The milestone is more about Exxon\'s decline than it is about Chevron\'s ascent, because the entire oil industry has been battered by a fall in crude prices sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.

Exxon\'s market value has fallen more than 50% since the start of the year, settling at $141.6 billion at market close Wednesday. Chevron\'s value is down about 39% to $142.0 billion. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 has risen almost 6% in the same period.  Exxon\'s stock has faced pressure from a number of events including its ousting from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in August and two consecutive quarters of loss.

Exxon\'s market value has fallen more than 50% from the start of the year. Markets Insider  While Chevron has faced similar challenges — it reported an $8.3 billion loss in the second quarter — some analysts consider it a more resilient pick when oil is cheap. Chevron also has a stronger balance sheet than Exxon, according to a note published in early September by Goldman Sachs.

Exxon was once the world\'s largest company  Seven years ago, Exxon was the largest company in the world by market value. It was worth almost half a trillion dollars by mid-2014 when oil was trading above $100 a barrel.  Exxon\'s financial losses are tied to the recent collapse of oil markets.

The company spent more than $260 billion on capital expenditures between 2009 and 2019, The Journal said, and added $45 billion in debt.  Investors are now rewarding companies that are disciplined with their capital, Bank of America said.

The Nio Analyst: Nick Lai upgraded Nio\'s stock from Neutral to Overweight and increased the price target from $14 to $40.  Emerging and Structural Shift In Industry Trend: Penetration of Chinese NEVs that includes fuel cell, hybrid and battery vehicles is poised to increase from less than 5% in 2019 to 20% in 2025, Lai said in a note. This is premised on a shift in customers from ICE to EVs and expected production cost-parity between ICE and EV by 2022/23, as battery cost drops further.  China is witnessing ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" phenomenon, which is not only leading to a fast growing NEV addressable market but also benefitting suppliers relevant to the broader EV supply chain, Lai said.  JPMorgan\'s positive view on Nio is based on its bullish top-down sector view. The analyst estimates Nio will likely earn a 7% market share in the passenger EV market by 2025, or specifically a 30% share in the premium space the company focuses on.  Related Link: Nio\'s 4th Annual \'Nio Day\' Coming In January: What Investors Need To Know  Nio, being within the top 10 by market share, will benefit from the emerging and structural shift from ""B"" to ""C,"" as more EV buyers are individuals, rather than corporates or individuals living in cities with purchase quotas, the analyst said.  nio_2_0.png  The company also stands to gain from the extension of NEV subsidy program toward 2022, with battery swap business model being covered by government\'s subsidy, and a meaningful pick up in new model launches.  ""We come to the conclusion that Nio remains attractive from a long term perspective,"" Lai wrote in the note.  Upcoming Catalysts: Anticipated solid third-quarter results in mid-November. The analyst expects third-quarter gross profit margin to expand further from 8% in the second quarter to 12% in the third quarter.  Story continues  Robust order backlog, in particular, for the newly launched EC6 crossover model is another catalyst.

The bank is rolling out a checking account that is paired with a new fintech-inspired service called QuickAccept, according to JPMorgan executives. QuickAccept lets merchants take card payments within minutes, either through a mobile app or a contactless card reader, and users will see sales hit their Chase business accounts on the same day.  That fast funding is offered free, unlike competitors including Square, which typically take a day or more and charge a 1.5% fee to make instant transfers to external accounts.  ""Our competition either doesn\'t have same-day funding, or they charge for it,"" Max Neukirchen, CEO of JPMorgan\'s merchant services arm, said in an interview. ""We think it\'s a great differentiator for businesses because getting money into their account quickly is so important as they manage their cash flow.""  The move shows that JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, isn\'t content letting newer rivals monopolize emerging trends. Small merchants struggled with point-of-sale card transactions until 2009, when Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey came up with the idea for a piece of hardware that attached to smartphones. That was the launching point for Square, and now the company manages $100 billion in payment volumes annually and has an $83 billion market capitalization.  That swift ascent caught the eye of JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who mentioned Square during a February 2019 investor conference. ""They came out with this whole dongle to process stuff and it was a great idea,"" Dimon said at the event. ""They did all stuff we could have done that we didn\'t do.""  Square shares dropped 4.3% Wednesday.  Besides Square, PayPal is a major player in this arena. The payments firm, which first gained traction as the rails for eBay sellers, now has 346 million active accounts globally. Another player is Clover, an Andreessen Horowitz-backed start-up that was acquired by First Data in 2012. First Data was later bought by Fiserv.']","[""AstraZeneca has resumed the U.S. trial of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine after approval by regulators, and Johnson & Johnson is preparing to resume its trial as well, the companies said on Friday.  AstraZeneca's U.S. trial was paused on Sept. 6 after a report of a serious neurological illness, believed to be transverse myelitis, in a participant in the company's UK trial. J&J paused its large, late-stage trial last week after a study participant became ill and the company said an independent safety panel was investigating.  J&J said on Friday that the safety panel, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill.  J&J is preparing to resume its trial in the United States and is in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States as well, it said.  So far, the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients' illness.  AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case.  Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca U.S. trial was set to resume as early as this week, citing four sources familiar with the situation.

Advertisement  Investors\' laser focus on COVID-19 vaccine trials became apparent on Tuesday as Johnson & Johnson fell as much as 3% in premarket trading despite reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.  On Monday evening, the healthcare giant said it paused its phase-three COVID-19 vaccine trial because of a participant\'s ""unexplained illness.""  The company said that it didn\'t know whether the participant was in the trial\'s placebo arm or vaccine arm and that it was awaiting a review of the illness from an independent data and safety monitoring board.

In 2020, many investors are probably happy if they\'ve managed to avoid losing a significant chunk of their investments. Even though the markets are doing well of late, many healthcare stocks are still struggling amid the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, shares of drugmaker Merck are down 12% year to date -- and that\'s still better than biotech stock Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, which has plummeted 29% over the same period. The lesson of 2020 is this: Whether we\'re in a bull or bear market, investors need to be diligent when choosing which stocks to invest in for the long-haul, because some stocks are tougher to break than others.  Johnson & Johnson is one of the safer stocks you can invest in, no matter the current climate. Its consumer health brands, including Aveeno, Neutrogena, and Band-Aid, are popular all over the world, and its diverse segments ensure that its financials remain stable, making the stock an attractive long-term investment. Johnson & Johnson is resilient in good times and bad -- even during a global pandemic. Let\'s take a look at how much you could\'ve made if you bought shares of the company back in January.  Could Johnson & Johnson have made you a millionaire?  In early January, shares of Johnson & Johnson were trading at around $145. If you were to invest $1,000 in the stock at that price, you\'d be able to buy approximately seven shares. Today, with the stock at about $149, your investment would be worth about $1,043. In a very strong 2019, when the S&P 500 soared 29%, Johnson & Johnson\'s stock was well below the index and up only 13% over the year. Now, the stock has kept better pace with the index\'s recovery, up 4% on the year compared to the S&P 500\'s 9%.  Johnson & Johnson won\'t make you a millionaire -- at least, not in the short term. The main attractions of Johnson & Johnson as an investment are its long-term stability and diverse portfolio of medical services and products. The company has also earned the title of Dividend King, which means that it has increased its payouts for more than 50 years in a row. In April, Johnson & Johnson raised its quarterly dividend payments by 6.3% to $1.01 per share. That comes out to an annual yield of 2.7% -- well above the S&P 500 average of 2%.  How has the stock stayed afloat in 2020?  A few of Johnson & Johnson\'s business segments have definitely benefited from stay-at-home orders and stock-up purchasing trends. Consumers have been loading up on day-to-day essentials like vitamins and pharmaceutical products. On Oct. 13, the New Jersey-based company released its third-quarter earnings for the period ended Sept. 30; its sales remained consistent, with worldwide revenue of $21.1 billion having risen 1.7% year over year. Medical device sales dropped 3.6% to $6.2 billion as procedure delays and deferrals at hospitals continued. However, other segments continued to grow, including pharmaceuticals, its largest segment, which recorded revenues of $11.4 billion -- up 5% from the prior-year period.  And the company is optimistic about the rest of the year, slightly raising its guidance from July. Johnson & Johnson now expects its reported sales to fall within a range of $81.2 billion to $82 billion for the full year. That\'s up from a previous forecast of $79.9 billion to $81.4 billion. Although it\'s not a huge change, the move signals internal optimism about what\'s to come.  Johnson & Johnson\'s place in the coronavirus vaccine race  Another reason why the stock has fared well in 2020 is that Johnson & Johnson has been working on a vaccine candidate for COVID-19. In September, the company began phase 3 trials with plans to enroll 60,000 participants. Interim results from the drug\'s phase 1/2a trials showed that it was so far safe and effective, with most adverse events considered mild or moderate. The vaccine candidate, JNJ-78436735, also ""induced a strong neutralizing antibody response in nearly all participants aged 18 years and older and was generally well-tolerated.""  However, clinical trials haven\'t been totally smooth. On Oct. 12, the company announced that it would temporarily pause the clinical trials after one participant developed an unexplained illness. Vaccine developer AstraZeneca (AZN 0.37%) also recently paused its trials in September after an unexplained illness occurred in one participant. And while AstraZeneca has resumed its trials in other parts of the world, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is still looking into the issue. At this stage, it\'s too early to know when Johnson & Johnson may resume its trials.  Is Johnson & Johnson a buy?  If you\'re a growth investor expecting a $1,000 investment to turn into $5,000, then Johnson & Johnson stock probably isn\'t for you. Over the course of 10 years, Johnson & Johnson shares are up over 130%, which would have more than doubled your investment over that time. But it\'s still nowhere near the 200% returns the S&P 500 has generated over the same period. The real value in Johnson & Johnson is apparent in its stability and increasing dividends. If you\'re looking for a stock that can double your money and aren\'t ready to wait a decade or longer for that to happen, you\'re better off looking at other investment options.', 'Benchmarks closed sharply lower on Monday as possibilities over a fresh stimulus package remain doubtful before the presidential election.

Zacks Investment Research', 'Alex Gorsky, Chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, rings the opening bell to celebrate the 75th anniversary of his company\'s listing at the New York Stock Exchange, September 17, 2019.  Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street\'s expectations, led by higher sales in its medical-device unit and higher demand for some of its drugs.  J&J reported an adjusted earnings of $2.20 per share, higher than the $1.98 per share projected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The company generated $21.08 billion in revenue, higher than the $20.2 billion expected and up from $20.72 last year.  The company also raised its full-year guidance, expecting adjusted earnings of $7.95 to $8.05 from per share from $7.75 to $7.95 per share. It also raised its sales forecast to a range of $82 billion to $82.8 billion from $79.9 billion to $81.4 billion.  J&J\'s pharmaceutical business, which is working on a coronavirus vaccine, generated $11.4 billion in revenue, a 5% year-over-year increase. The vaccine\'s late-stage trial was just paused after one of its participants reported an ""adverse event,"" Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview on CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday.  J&J\'s share price fell1.5% on Tuesday, to $149.55 per share.  The company\'s consumer unit, which makes products such as Listerine, generated $3.5 billion in revenue, up 1.3% from a year earlier. Its medical device unit generated $6.1 billion, a 1.7% increase.  ""Our world-class R&D team is working tirelessly to advance the Phase 3 trials of our COVID- 19 vaccine and to uphold the highest standards of transparency, safety and efficacy; while other dedicated teams provide ongoing support to hospitals and patients as they return to sites of care, and ensure patients and consumers have the medicines and products they need,"" J&J CEO Alex Gorsky said in a press release.  J&J began its phase three trial testing of its potential coronavirus vaccine last month, becoming the fourth drugmaker backed by the Trump administration\'s Covid-19 vaccine program Operation Warp Speed to enter late-stage testing.  J&J confirmed to STAT News on Monday that the 60,000-patient clinical trial had been temporarily paused due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.  AstraZeneca announced on Sept. 8 that its trial had been put on hold due to an unexplained illness in a patient in the United Kingdom. The trial has since resumed in the U.K. and other countries, but is still on hold in the United States.', ""Many large pharmaceutical companies fall into the category of widow-and-orphan stocks -- stocks that have a relatively high dividend yield and pose very low risks to investors. An investment in a widow-and-orphan stock is intended to grow over time, provide income, and generally go untouched for long periods. When evaluating companies offering that kind of safety, traditional metrics sometimes fail to capture some of the most important factors of the company.  AbbVie (ABBV 0.98%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 1.24%) are two pharmaceutical companies that fit the widow-and-orphan description. So which is a better buy right now?  So similar, yet so different  Pharmaceutical companies like AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson all develop, manufacture, and market drugs, but are wildly different businesses when you dig into the details. AbbVie was spun out of Abbott Labs (ABT 0.98%) in 2013 in order separate its pharmaceutical business from its legacy medical products business. Shortly after the split, AbbVie launched Humira, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease, which made up more than half the company's revenue in 2019. Although Humira is the currently the best-selling drug in the world, it will face an increasing number of biosimilar challengers over the next several years. AbbVie completed its acquisition of Allergan for $63 billion in May in an attempt to diversify its revenue streams and reduce the risk inherent in one drug providing the majority of the company's sales. Allergan sports a growing global aesthetics business, with leading brands Botox and Juvederm.  Johnson & Johnson is as diversified as a healthcare company can get. In 2019, the company's $82 billion in sales was spread across multiple products in pharmaceuticals ($42 billion), consumer products ($14 billion), and medical devices ($26 billion). The risk for Johnson & Johnson lies in the never-ending stream of legal settlements related to various errors, oversights, and malfeasance from the past. A recent analysis estimated the company could shell out more than $6 billion to settle the various lawsuits that are currently active. These are not the only differences between the two companies. Historical financial data can also help investors answer the question of which will make a better investment going forward.  Looking in the rearview mirror  We've all heard the disclaimer that past performance is no guarantee of future results, but digging into the past can help us better understand where each company stands today. If we compare metrics related to growth, yield, and profitability since AbbVie went public, it should give us an idea of how the share prices got to where they are, and how they might fare in the future. When we focus on stock price, we see that AbbVie has had an edge since 2013, returning about 40% more than Johnson & Johnson.  Another useful point of comparison between two large widow-and-orphan stocks is their dividends. As mentioned above, many people buy these stocks for a stable income stream and the luxury of not having to pay attention to the stock price. Again, AbbVie delivers. Management has put an emphasis on increasing the yield -- and it shows.  If sales are not growing, eventually profits, dividends, and usually returns, are cast aside as a company shrinks. Neither of these companies is setting the world on fire with amazing year over year revenue growth, however, neither's dividend is at risk. Both companies have payout ratios -- the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends -- below 100%. Johnson & Johnson has a slightly safer dividend as its payout ratio is 66%, compared to 81% for AbbVie.  Yet another way to for investors to compare companies is by evaluating the cash flow yield metric. This measure is the amount of free cash flow a company generates divided by its market capitalization. Although it can be useful when comparing two similar companies, market capitalization and free cash flows can fluctuate wildly for stocks. Currently, AbbVie sees a significantly higher portion of every dollar end up as cash to do with what they please. AbbVie's free cash flow yield is 10.5% compared to 4.3% for Johnson & Johnson. This may be explained by Johnson & Johnson's mix of businesses with lower profit margins.  So, AbbVie's stock has consistently outperformed Johnson & Johnson's, but investors also need to consider how the market is valuing both companies' futures.  Looking through the windshield  Using the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, it is clear that investors value a dollar of Johnson & Johnson's earnings more dearly than a dollar of AbbVie's. Investors are currently paying 19 times next year's earnings for Johnson & Johnson and only 8.4 times AbbVie's. Higher P/E ratios are often connected to a company's anticipated growth rate, and analyst estimates can help us confirm the theory. Headlines are generated when companies beat or miss earnings estimates each quarter, but the value of a company is driven by what it earns over longer periods. The chart below shows that estimates of Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie's growth over the next three to five years are very similar. The difference in P/E ratios doesn't appear to be driven by anticipated growth rates.  The final tally  Despite a similar growth rate and a poorer cash flow yield, the market thinks a dollar of Johnson & Johnson earnings is more than twice as valuable as the same dollar generated by AbbVie. Is this reasonable, or is it a mistake by the market that investors can take advantage of?  Johnson & Johnson's brand name is certainly worth some premium. After all, the company has been around since 1886 and has paid a dividend for 48 straight years. AbbVie only came to the public markets in 2013. Johnson & Johnson has also been on Fortune Magazine's most-admired list for 18 consecutive years. Perhaps Johnson & Johnson's greatest strength is its diversification. Having such breadth of businesses all contributing to revenue provides a lot of comfort in times of market turmoil, and guarantees that no one product will have much impact on your investment.  On the other hand, AbbVie has a very different story. Despite a pipeline of cancer drugs and large recent acquisition, more than half of the company's sales comes from one product. The company is also just seven years old. AbbVie does, however, show up in Fortune's list. The company was listed as the 53rd most admired company in 2020 and the 87th best company to work for.  When you stack up the data, it's clear investors love Johnson & Johnson for its safety and history. But investing is about the future, not the past. I believe investors who are willing to tolerate a little more risk will enjoy better returns buying shares of AbbVie due to its efforts to diversify sources of revenue and the flexibility its strong cash flow yield provides. In five years, AbbVie may look more like Johnson & Johnson than it does today. If that is the case, expect the pharmaceutical company's shares to go much higher.""]","['Global travel screeched to a halt during the pandemic, and it\'s hurting credit card companies\' bottom line.  American Express , Mastercard and Visa all reported double-digit drops in profit for the recent quarter, compared to a year ago. The companies pointed to a plunge in international travel as borders remain closed during the pandemic.  The companies earn a fee off of every transaction that runs on their network, while American Express also makes a significant portion of revenue from annual fees. A lack of cross-border payments is especially painful as those card swipes have higher margins, and end up being more lucrative.  Visa was the latest major card company to report results on Wednesday. Cross-border transactions fell 29%, while Visa\'s revenue in the quarter was down 17% from a year ago. The company did not give guidance based on uncertainty around the virus, but said the cross-border weakness remains a ""significant and continued drag on revenue growth."" That will likely continue into 2021, according to Visa\'s CFO Vasant Prabhu.  ""The cross-border recovery has been sluggish since borders remain closed, and there are significant impediments of crossing borders like quarantines and other such restrictions,"" Prabhu said on a call with analysts Wednesday.  Prabhu cited ""significant uncertainties"" including the impact of spikes in Covid infections happening in the U.S. and Europe, the timing of reopening of borders, the impact of therapeutics and a vaccine, additional stimulus programs and the economic impact once stimulus programs end. Covid cases in Europe spurred leaders of Germany and France to announce new economic restrictions for the next month, while new cases in the U.S. have hit record highs in recent weeks.  Visa rival Mastercard reported earnings Wednesday, with many of the same themes. Mastercard\'s net income fell 28% year over year, and net revenue fell 14%, missing analysts\' expectations. The company reported a 36% drop in cross-border volumes, and did not forecast a rebound in travel spending anytime soon.  ""While we believe that cross-border will ultimately recover, it will take time for people to build their confidence in the safety of travel,"" Mastercard\'s chief financial officer, Sachin Mehra, said on a call with analysts Wednesday. ""We believe that is tied to the broad availability of vaccines and therapeutics, likely towards the latter part of next year.""  Shares of Mastercard have fared the worst in the past week, and are down 11% this week. Visa and American Express are down 8% and 10% this week, respectively.', ""Theme parks have been closed for most of the year due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but investors haven't gone without thrills: The stock market has taken them on one of the wildest rides of their lives. The benchmark S&P 500 lost more than a third of its value in about a month during the first quarter, then took less than five months to completely recoup all of its losses. That's about a decade's worth of volatility crammed into a six-month time frame.  The good news for investors with a long-term mindset is that this volatility has allowed them to buy into great companies on the cheap. Best of all, you don't need to start with a lot to become wealthy over time by investing in high-quality companies.  If you have $250 to put toward your financial independence, you have more than enough to buy into some of the best stocks on Wall Street.  Teladoc Health  Making bank is easy when you own businesses on the leading edge of the healthcare innovation curve. That's why telemedicine pioneer Teladoc Health (TDOC -2.91%) is such a no-brainer buy for investors with $250 to put to work.  Teladoc has directly benefited from the COVID-19 crisis. Physicians and hospitals are doing their best to streamline medical visits while also keeping at-risk patients out of their offices. Telemedicine is serving its purpose, which is why we saw virtual visits more than triple for Teladoc during the second quarter.  However, Teladoc's business was booming well before the coronavirus pandemic struck. The company's compound annual growth over the past seven years is close to 75%, which is a direct reflection of the benefits of virtual visits throughout the healthcare industry. Virtual visits are less costly for insurance companies, and can be far more convenient for both the patient and physician.  What's more, Teladoc Health is in the process of acquiring applied health signals leader Livongo Health (LVGO) in an $18.5 billion cash-and-stock deal. Livongo targets patients with chronic illnesses and relies on artificial intelligence to send its subscribing members tips and nudges. These nudges help patients better control the symptoms associated with their chronic illness. Livongo has nearly doubled or more than doubled its full-year Diabetes member count in each of the past three years.  As a combined company, Teladoc and Livongo could offer some of the most robust sales growth in the entire healthcare sector.  Innovative Industrial Properties  Investing in the marijuana industry has been hit-and-miss for the past 18 months. But one company that's been a surefire hit is cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR 0.50%).  Like any REIT, the game plan is simple: Buy assets and lease them out for extended periods of time. In IIP's case, it purchases cultivation and processing assets in the U.S. and leases them out for between 10 and 20 years. As of the beginning of this week, the company owned 63 assets in 16 states, with a weighted-average lease length of 16.2 years.  The beauty of the REIT model is that it's highly transparent and very predictable. Innovative Industrial Properties remains responsible for the upkeep of its owned assets, but the costs to do so are generally minimal (beyond the initial purchase price for a property). Further, IIP is able to pass along inflationary-based rent hikes each year, and collects a 1.5% property management fee tied to this base rental rate. In other words, there's some very modest, inflation-topping organic growth built into the company's business model.  Innovative Industrial Properties has also benefited from a lack of cannabis banking reform in the United States. With multistate operators struggling to find consistent access to capital, IIP has stepped with its sale-leaseback program. With these deals, IIP acquires an asset for cash and immediately leases it back to the seller. This helps to beef up the balance sheets of multistate operators, while netting IIP a long-term tenant.  Innovative Industrial Properties is the most profitable marijuana stock on a per-share basis in the industry, and is the only pure-play company to currently pay a dividend.  Visa  When in doubt, buy into companies that are proven winners. Although financial stocks are inherently cyclical, payment facilitator Visa (V 2.55%) has shown time and again that it's virtually unstoppable over the long run.  Just how dominant has Visa been? Between 2009 and 2018, the dollar amount traversing its credit card networks in the U.S. increased by more than 155%, with Visa expanding its market share of credit card purchase volume in the U.S. by over 10 percentage points to 53%. That's more than 30 percentage points higher than chief rival Mastercard as of 2018. Since the U.S. is a consumption-driven economy, Visa is sitting pretty as the preferred payment facilitator for the world's top economy.  Also of note, Visa is strictly a payment facilitator and not a lender. Though some of the company's peers act as both payment processors and lenders, the lure of double-dipping has never tempted Visa's management. That can certainly be good news during periods of recession, because it means no direct exposure to rising credit delinquencies for Visa. With no worries about setting aside capital for loan-loss provisions, Visa's profit margin remains at or above 50%.  Visa also has one heck of a cashless opportunity beyond the borders of the United States. In 2016, it acquired Visa Europe in order to access the region's developed and developing markets. It has ample opportunity to expand its processing infrastructure into underbanked regions of the world (e.g., Africa and the Middle East), too. With a majority of global transactions still conducted in cash, it's not as if Visa lacks for long-term growth opportunities."", ""Dev Kantesaria’s Valley Forge Capital is a long-focused equity investment firm that was founded in 2007.

While Visa has historically been more popular among hedge funds, the gap has been closing over the past six quarters.  The Visa/Mastercard duopoly has come under fire in Britain for what have been deemed the excessive fees which retailers have increasingly been forced to contend with as card payments become the norm over cash during the pandemic.

(NYSE:PG) recently reported earnings results that delivered an organic growth rate that was more than twice that of Wall Street's expectations.  Excellent growth combined with a long history of dividend growth is one of the reasons that Procter & Gamble is a favorite amongst dividend growth investors. I believe the most recent quarter shows the strength of Procter & Gamble's business, and that the company will continue to raise its dividend. Thus, I added to my position on Oct. 20 at a price of $142.47, even as the stock has become overvalued.      Quarterly highlights  Procter & Gamble released earnings results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2021 on Oct. 20 (the company's fiscal year ends June 30).  The company reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.63, $0.20 ahead of consensus estimates and a 19% increase from the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency translation, EPS was up 22%. Revenue surged 8.5% to $19.3 billion, $930 million higher than expected. This was the highest rate of year-over-year revenue growth since at least fiscal year 2016.  What really stood out was the company's organic growth.  Why I Didn't Mind Paying Up for Procter & Gamble  Source: Procter & Gamble's First Quarter Earnings Presentation.  Organic growth of 9% was more than twice that of estimates of 4.1%. Much of this growth was driven by organic volumes, which were higher by 7%, but an increase in pricing and an improvement in product mix each contributed 1% to results.  Each product segment within Procter & Gamble showed sales and volume growth.  The Beauty segment saw an organic sales growth of 7%, mostly due to better volumes, but pricing added 1% to results. This segment has performed quite well for Procter & Gamble over the years as this quarter marked the 20th in a row of organic sales growth. Hair care had double-digit growth in North America and Greater China, led by an increase in premium product sales. Skin and personal care benefited from the launch of new hand soap and hand sanitizer products. Global cleansing sales were up 30% year-over-year, with every region posting double-digit growth. New products in Olay also performed well in North America, but weakness in the skin care product line SK-II led to a market share decline of 0.4% for this segment.  Story continues  Grooming organic sales were higher by 6%, with a 5% improvement in volumes. Shave care sales were flat as weakness in male blades and razors offset high single-digit gains in female blades and razors. Higher demand for dry shaving and styling products led to a 30% gain in appliances. North America sales were slightly higher while Greater China and Latin America were up double digits due to volume gains. While the global shave market share was down 0.6%, appliance market share was higher by 1.1%. Product mix led to a 1.8% decline in market share for the Grooming segment as a whole.  Health Care organic sales were up 12% due to strong volume growth and a slight increase in pricing and mix. Oral care was a real source of strength as global sales were up a mid-teens percentage. This was due to higher demand for tooth paste and power toothbrush products, especially amongst the professional dental hygiene channel. Personal health care experienced better demand in digestive and wellness products. The businesses that Procter & Gamble acquired from its purchase of Merck & Company's (NYSE:MRK) consumer health business last year were up double-digits. Market share was up 1.4% for this segment.  Fabric & Home sales improved 14% due to 10% growth in volumes and 4% improvement in product mix. Home care sales spiked 30%, including 20% growth in every business in this category. Fabric was up high single-digits globally, but posted high teens growth in North America due to the company's premium products in laundry and fabric enhancers. Europe produced a low single-digit growth rate as pricing and mix helped to offset market contraction. This segment's market share was up 1.2%.  Organic sales for the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment improved 4%. Baby care was down by a low single-digit rate as declines in Greater China and Europe more than offset an uptick in growth in North America. This region saw growth in premium products, pants and wipes. Feminine care benefited from higher overall sales, price increases and an improvement in mix in the Always Discreet product line. Family care was up double-digits due to demand and lower promotional spending. Market share contracted 0.4% due to results in regions outside of North America.  Due to first quarter results, Procter & Gamble raised its expectations for organic growth for the fiscal year to a range of 4% to 5%, up from 2% to 4% previously. The company expects foreign currency exchange to be a 1% headwind to results.  Excluding a $0.15 to $0.20 per share impairment charge due to early retirement of debt, Procter & Gamble expects core EPS growth of 5% to 8% for the year. Using last year's core EPS of $5.12, the company's adjusted EPS is projected to fall in a range of $5.38 to $5.53 for fiscal year 2021.  Valuation  If there is a quibble with shares of Procter & Gamble, it is the stock's valuation. Using Friday's closing price of $142.38 and the midpoint for expected EPS of $5.46, Procter & Gamble has a forward price-earnings ratio of 26.1. This is above the five and 10-year average price-earnings ratios of 21.6 and 19.8, respectively.  Applying the midpoint for EPS by the five-year average price-earnings ratio results in a price of ~$118, which is 17% lower than the most recent closing price. Procter & Gamble's stock is also trading above its intrinsic value according to the GF Value.  Why I Didn't Mind Paying Up for Procter & Gamble  Procter & Gamble's GF Value is $114.60, which means that the stock has a current price-to-GF Value ratio of 1.24. This earns the stock a ranking of modestly overvalued.  My thoughts  Procter & Gamble had an excellent first quarter, easily topping revenue and EPS estimates. The company's organic growth was well above what was expected as the company has seen an increase in volumes.  The company has spent much of the past few years undergoing a transformation that has reduced the number of brands it carries from 170 to 65 today. This has enabled Procter & Gamble to focus on its core brands, something that has helped the company in recent quarters.  There's no argument that the stock is overvalued today, using either the stock's historical valuation or its intrinsic value. However, I think it is likely that Procter & Gamble will continue to see high rates of organic growth.  This combined with the company's 64 consecutive years of dividend increases should make the stock one of the more appealing names in the consumer space for dividend growth investors. This is exactly why I was comfortable purchasing more shares of Procter & Gamble even at an elevated multiple.  Author disclosure: The author has a long position in the Procter & Gamble Company.

"", 'Procter & Gamble reported on Tuesday that fiscal first-quarter revenue rose 9%, fueled by demand for its cleaning and laundry products during the coronavirus pandemic.  On the heels of the strong quarter, P&G raised its sales outlook and expectations for core earnings growth for fiscal 2021.  Shares of the company rose 2% in morning trading.  Here\'s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:  Earnings per share: $1.63 vs. $1.42 expected  Revenue: $19.32 billion vs. $18.38 billion expected  The company reported net income of $4.28 billion, or $1.63 per share, up from $3.59 billion, or $1.36 per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting earnings of $1.42 per share.  Net sales rose 9% to $19.32 billion, topping expectations of $18.38 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, also climbed 9% in the quarter. Higher demand in North America, P&G\'s largest market, helped drive sales growth.  All of P&G\'s five business segments reported organic sales growth. CFO and COO Jon Moeller said on CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" that the U.S. saw growth of 16% and China reported growth of 12%. He told reporters on a press call that the company has not seen U.S. consumers opting for cheaper brands, despite the impasse in another stimulus package from the federal government.  Moeller said that e-commerce now accounts for about 11% or 12% of total sales.  Fabric and home care, which includes Tide and Comet cleaning products, saw the highest jump, with organic sales rising 14% in the quarter.  The home care segment saw organic sales soar 30%, fueled by demand for home cleaning products, like Mr. Clean.  Health care, which includes Crest toothpaste, Vicks, Pepto-Bismol and Oral-B, also reported double-digit organic sales growth. More consumers bought its digestive and wellness products.  Its beauty segment saw organic sales growth of 7%. The launch of Safeguard hand soap and hand sanitizer and new products from Olay lifted North American sales for skin and personal care.  Organic sales for its grooming business rose 6% in the quarter, but its shaving business, which includes Gillette and Venus brands, reported flat organic sales. P&G said women\'s razors and blades rose by single digits, but men aren\'t shaving as much during the pandemic.  The company\'s baby, health and family care segment reported organic sales growth of 4%. The category includes Pampers diapers, Bounty paper towels and Charmin toilet paper.  As consumers spend more time watching television and checking social media, P&G is putting more money into advertising. Higher demand for cleaning products also pushed the company to spend more on advertising to put its brands front and center.  ""This is not the time to step back,"" Moeller said.  Moeller also said that promotions in the U.S. have largely returned to normal levels, with the exception of products that are still recovering from stockouts.  P&G now expects sales growth of 3% to 4% during fiscal 2021, up from its prior forecast of 1% to 3%. Organic revenue is now forecast to rise by 4% to 5%, higher than its previous expectations of 2% to 4%.  While the early retirement of debt will reduce its net income by 5 to 20 cents a share this fiscal year, core earnings per share will be higher than previously expected. The company is forecasting growth of 5% to 8%, up from its prior forecast of 3% to 7%. After-tax foreign exchange impacts and freight costs are expected to hit earnings by a combined $375 million.  P&G expects to buy back more stock as well during the fiscal year. The company previously said it would spend $6 billion to $8 billion on buying back shares but now plans on spending $7 billion to $9 billion.', ""Procter & Gamble (PG 0.12%) and Costco Wholesale (COST 1.60%) perform fundamentally different functions. P&G produces personal care products, and Costco is one of its numerous retailers.  However, both are large-cap stocks supported by mature companies that deliver rising profits and steady dividend increases. Let's review both companies to see which investment offers more profit potential.  The state of Costco  Costco leads the warehouse retailing business, outselling its most direct competitors, Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale. It also holds its own against other major brick-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart and Target. Moreover, it competes successfully with Amazon, primarily by turning a combined physical store and online presence to its advantage.  Still, Costco's success comes down to member growth and retention. Memberships, which currently start at $60 per year, make up the overwhelming majority of the company's profits. This model has allowed the company to grow to 552 warehouses across 45 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. It also operates an additional 244 warehouses in 11 other countries on four different continents.  Due to its success, Costco is a relatively expensive stock. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has risen to about 39. In Costco's most recent quarter, earnings increased by nearly 27% from year-ago levels as the pandemic stoked sales of consumer staples. However, earnings for fiscal 2020 as a whole rose by just over 9% from 2019 levels. This is more in line with forecasts, which point to an expected 10% net income increase in each of the next two years.  Costco also offers a dividend, which it has increased every year since 2004. However, with the $2.80 per year payout yielding only about 0.73%, most buy this stock in hopes of gains.  How Procter & Gamble fares  Procter & Gamble remains a leading company in personal care products. For much of its 180-year history, brands such as Tide laundry detergent, Bounty paper towels, and Gillette razors produced tidy profits for the personal care giant.  For most of that time, Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive served as its most direct competitors. However, as e-commerce took off, upstart, internet-based operations could compete more effectively. Consequently, P&G could no longer depend on name recognition and control of shelf space to drive sales.  Under current CEO David S. Taylor, it has resembled a start-up in some respects, buying products like Native deodorant that have sold well online. Thus, despite selling mostly commoditized products, it continues to drive growth.  Its forward P/E ratio now stands at around 27. P&G predicted between 3% and 7% core earnings-per-share growth for the upcoming fiscal year. This is in line with analyst forecasts, which predict increases of just under 6% in fiscal 2021 and about 7% for fiscal 2022. Nonetheless, despite steady growth, the stock appears pricey.  Where P&G stands out is with its dividend. At a yield of about 2.2%, the dividend of just over $3.16 per year is not noteworthy. Nonetheless, thanks to the company's 64-year track record of dividend increases, it is a draw for income-oriented stockholders.  Costco or Procter & Gamble?  From a valuation perspective, both Costco and Procter & Gamble have elevated earnings multiples relative to their expected profit growth. However, if I had to choose one, I would give the edge to Costco. For one, even amid high demand for personal care products during the pandemic, Costco stock has outperformed Procter & Gamble shares in 2020.  Additionally, Procter & Gamble already operates in more than 180 countries. While that is an impressive feat that few companies have accomplished, it leaves P&G with few new markets to tap.  Conversely, Costco operates in only a few countries. Nonetheless, it has shown that it can succeed abroad despite cultural differences. This bodes well for its international expansion for many years to come.  Both companies appear positioned to continue their growth and hike their dividends annually. However, with faster profit growth and more room for expansion, Costco stock seems to offer a more lucrative value proposition despite its higher multiple.""]","['Global travel screeched to a halt during the pandemic, and it\'s hurting credit card companies\' bottom line.  American Express , Mastercard and Visa all reported double-digit drops in profit for the recent quarter, compared to a year ago. The companies pointed to a plunge in international travel as borders remain closed during the pandemic.  The companies earn a fee off of every transaction that runs on their network, while American Express also makes a significant portion of revenue from annual fees. A lack of cross-border payments is especially painful as those card swipes have higher margins, and end up being more lucrative.  Visa was the latest major card company to report results on Wednesday. Cross-border transactions fell 29%, while Visa\'s revenue in the quarter was down 17% from a year ago. The company did not give guidance based on uncertainty around the virus, but said the cross-border weakness remains a ""significant and continued drag on revenue growth."" That will likely continue into 2021, according to Visa\'s CFO Vasant Prabhu.  ""The cross-border recovery has been sluggish since borders remain closed, and there are significant impediments of crossing borders like quarantines and other such restrictions,"" Prabhu said on a call with analysts Wednesday.  Prabhu cited ""significant uncertainties"" including the impact of spikes in Covid infections happening in the U.S. and Europe, the timing of reopening of borders, the impact of therapeutics and a vaccine, additional stimulus programs and the economic impact once stimulus programs end. Covid cases in Europe spurred leaders of Germany and France to announce new economic restrictions for the next month, while new cases in the U.S. have hit record highs in recent weeks.  Visa rival Mastercard reported earnings Wednesday, with many of the same themes. Mastercard\'s net income fell 28% year over year, and net revenue fell 14%, missing analysts\' expectations. The company reported a 36% drop in cross-border volumes, and did not forecast a rebound in travel spending anytime soon.  ""While we believe that cross-border will ultimately recover, it will take time for people to build their confidence in the safety of travel,"" Mastercard\'s chief financial officer, Sachin Mehra, said on a call with analysts Wednesday. ""We believe that is tied to the broad availability of vaccines and therapeutics, likely towards the latter part of next year.""  Shares of Mastercard have fared the worst in the past week, and are down 11% this week.

Visa Inc (NYSE:V)  - Shares Owned (as of June 30): 482,922 - Value of Holding (as of June 30): $93.29 million  - Q3 Return: 3.52%  Visa ranked as the sixth-most popular stock among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of June 30, with 154 of those funds owning Visa shares. 147 funds were shareholders of Visa’s longtime rival Mastercard, which ranked seventh. While Visa has historically been more popular among hedge funds, the gap has been closing over the past six quarters.  The Visa/Mastercard duopoly has come under fire in Britain for what have been deemed the excessive fees which retailers have increasingly been forced to contend with as card payments become the norm over cash during the pandemic. The British Retail Consortium found that credit cards carried transaction costs for retailers that were more than three times greater than debit cards at an average of $0.24.  Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)  - Shares Owned (as of June 30): 115,741 (+23%) - Value of Holding (as of June 30): $34.28 million  - Q3 Return: 10.14%  Lastly is Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), the tax software and accounting firm, which Valley Forge Capital bought 21,100 shares of during Q2. Hedge fund ownership of Intuit jumped by nearly 40% last year, but has dipped ever so slightly in 2020, remaining close to record high levels.  Intuit has surged by over 80% from its coronavirus low point and looks poised for double-digit revenue growth and equally strong EPS growth over the next three years. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss believes Intuit can improve its operating margins by 125 basis points annually during that period as it shifts from a customer acquisition strategy to one of per customer revenue growth.

A handful of America's larger biopharmaceutical businesses are so successful that they're able to deliver a slice of their profits to shareholders. These stocks might bounce around with the rest of the stock market, but you can count on these companies to deliver dividend payments to your account that grow every year.  Company (Symbol) Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Amgen AMGN 0.66% ) $239 2.6% Pfizer PFE -0.40% ) $37 4.1% Johnson & Johnson JNJ 1.24% ) $150 2.6%  1. Amgen  This highly successful drugmaker is actually one of America's pioneering biotechnology companies. In stark contrast to risky start-ups that the word biotechnology brings to mind, Amgen produces a steadily growing profit from sales of branded therapies.  Amgen isn't at all shy about distributing the profit it produces with its shareholders. In the first half of 2020, the company returned $1.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and another $1.9 billion in the form of quarterly dividend payments.  Amgen has raised its payout 103% higher over the past five years, and shareholders can reasonably expect more big dividend bumps ahead. Despite increasing its payout at a blazing pace, Amgen was able to make payments over the past 12 months using just 35% of the free cash flow its operations generated over the same time frame.  Amgen's product lineup sports drugs with blockbuster sales right now, and more new therapies rolling through the pipeline could allow the company to keep raising its payout for years to come.  Second-quarter sales of Enbrel, an injectable treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis that originally launched in 1998, came in at an annualized $4.5 billion, and this revenue stream isn't finished yet. Amgen recently won an appeals court ruling that will prevent biosimilar versions of Enbrel from competing for the same patients through 2029 in the United States.  2. Pfizer  This big pharma is in the middle of a megamerger expected to complete before the end of the year that involves its post-market exclusivity product segment UpJohn, and Mylan (MYL). Buying Pfizer shares now would entitle you to dividend payments from the new company, to be named Viatris, plus dividends from the Pfizer that remains.  UpJohn and Mylan have shown us through the years that successful brands don't necessarily need patent-protected market exclusivity to produce profits. Pfizer expects more than $4.0 billion in free cash flow from the entities that will combine to form Viatris later this year.  The Pfizer that remains will be a lean machine focused on developing new drugs for patients that need them. The company's oncology segment alone expects up to 14 potential approvals from the FDA by 2025.  In addition to an oncology segment ready to deliver blockbuster sales for years to come, BNT162, a coronavirus vaccine candidate Pfizer's is developing in collaboration with BioNTech (BNTX 0.65%) could provide evidence of efficacy before the end of October. The timing all depends on how soon data monitors see a predetermined number of volunteers test positive for COVID-19.  3. Johnson & Johnson  Amgen and Pfizer have regularly rising dividends, but neither can hold a candle to the reliability investors have come to expect from the world's largest healthcare company. Rising pharmaceutical sales coupled with reliable sales of consumer healthcare products and medical devices have allowed Johnson & Johnson to raise its payout for 58 consecutive years.  Despite COVID-19 pandemic headwinds that were expected to crimp the company's top and bottom lines, Johnson & Johnson recently reported third-quarter results that smashed through earlier expectations. While delayed surgical procedures pressured the company's medical device segment, higher than expected pharmaceutical sales pushed adjusted earnings 3.8% higher year over year to $2.20 per share.  Soaring sales of blood cancer drugs like Darzalex and Imbruvica helped pharmaceutical sales rise 5% year over year to $11.4 billion and more new drugs coming through the pipeline will continue moving the needle. That includes a coronavirus vaccine candidate with a potential advantage over BNT162 from BioNtech and Pfizer.  Johnson & Johnson's vaccine candidate Ad26COV2.S uses a non-replicating virus to deliver genetic material human cells use to produce copies of the spike protein the novel coronavirus relies on. This should spur our immune systems to produce antibodies that prevent real copies of the virus responsible for COVID-19 from conducting business as usual.  Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine candidate should be a lot easier transport and store than BNT162 and other RNA-based vaccines that can only be expected to remain effective for 24 hours in a standard refrigerator. Johnson & Johnson designed Ad26COV2.S to remain effective for at least three months when kept in the basic refrigerators healthcare providers already use to store existing vaccines.  Dividend investing takes time  Success for the vaccine candidates that Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson are developing could send these pharma stocks sharply higher overnight, but that's now why dividend investors find them attractive. All three have a proven track record for delivering profits that grow over time.  There are a lot of ups and downs in the drug-making business, and investors that want a portfolio that delivers a steadily growing income stream need to stick with companies that can overcome inevitable mishaps as they occur. All three of these large and diverse drugmakers have what it take to deliver market-beating gains, just remember to be patient if your new dividend-paying pharma stock hits a snag."", 'Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla effectively closed the door Tuesday on knowing whether or not its experimental coronavirus vaccine would work by the end of October.  On the New York pharma giant\'s third quarter earnings call, Bourla acknowledged the company has not yet started the first interim analysis for this final study, called a phase-three trial.  Additionally, the CEO said it typically takes five to seven days for an independent board of scientists to complete that review.  With four days left in October, that likely precludes a possible result coming this month.  In September, Bourla set public expectations for an October data readout, a timeline at odds with top government scientists like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Moncef Slaoui, Operation Warp Speed\'s chief scientist.  Instead, Bourla asked on Tuesday for patience, as the study progresses.  For more stories like this, sign up here for Business Insider\'s daily healthcare newsletter.

Advertisement  Pfizer is not on track to meet the ambitious public expectations it laid out last month, as effectiveness data for its coronavirus vaccine candidate are unlikely to arrive in October.  Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla acknowledged on a Tuesday call with Wall Street analysts that an interim analysis of data from this pivotal clinical trial has yet to begin. It typically takes five to seven days to complete that review, Bourla added, a timeline that all but ensures the public won\'t know this month if Pfizer\'s COVID-19 shot works or not.  ""We just ask everybody to be a little patient,"" Bourla said on the pharma giant\'s third quarter earnings call.  Over the past few months, Bourla has prominently positioned Pfizer not just as a frontrunner in the crowded race for a COVID-19 vaccine, but the leader of the pack. In September, he appeared on The ""Today"" show and CBS\' ""Face The Nation"" to predict ""we will have an answer by the end of October.""  Advertisement  While Bourla called this a prediction, he added the October timeline had a 60% or higher chance of happening based on Pfizer\'s modeling. No other drugmaker has put forward such an aggressive timeline, with the closest being Moderna, whose CEO has pegged November as the most likely timing for results, with October being unlikely.  Read more: The untold story of Moderna as the biotech\'s coronavirus vaccine faces a test that could make it one of the most consequential startups of all time  Experts thought that vaccine data in October was unlikely  The ambitious timeline aligned well with President Donald Trump\'s repeated predictions of having success on a vaccine before Election Day. Top government scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Operation Warp Speed\'s leader Moncef Slaoui, have questioned the likelihood of the October timeline.  An independent board of scientists will take the first look at the study\'s data when there are 32 symptomatic COVID-19 cases among trial volunteers. The study has enrolled more than 42,000 people who randomly get either two doses of Pfizer\'s shot or placebo injection.  Advertisement  Bourla confirmed Thursday that the study has not yet recorded 32 cases. Even when the study reaches that number, the vaccine must be highly efficacious to show a meaningful difference from the placebo group so early on. The trial will continue until 150 volunteers have COVID-19.  Read more: Pfizer and Moderna are neck-and-neck in the race to deliver the first effective coronavirus vaccine. Here\'s everything we know about the timeline and when you might be able to get a shot.  The FDA wants more data on how safe the vaccine is  In the past few weeks, however, career scientists at the US Food and Drug Administration were able to put forward minimum safety requirements for an emergency authorization that effectively prevented a COVID-19 vaccine from being OK\'d before the election.  Pfizer\'s trial will need to collect data into the third week of November to meet that safety requirement. Bourla said the company would announce any conclusive efficacy result — positive or negative — when it becomes available to the company, even if it comes before the safety data is ready to submit to regulators.  Advertisement  Wall Street analysts were keyed into the coronavirus vaccine program, peppering Bourla with questions on the trial\'s latest progress. At one point on Thursday\'s call, Pfizer\'s CEO thanked a Wall Street analyst for asking a question unrelated to COVID-19.

Then in early 2020, the coronavirus brought it all to a screeching halt. The stock market now has largely rebounded — the S&P 500, in fact, is around 3,400, almost exactly where it was when the market cratered in late February.  To look into the stock market growth, GOBankingRates researched historical prices to see what $1,000 invested in your favorite companies in 2010 would be worth 10 years later, as well as what the compound annual growth rate is to give you a sense of what the yearly return for each has been over time. Learn which companies have produced impressive growth rates.  Last updated: Oct. 7, 2020  Walt Disney Co. (DIS): $4,220.04  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $29.04  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $122.55  Compound annual growth rate: 15.49%  Disney’s stock prices were soaring above $150 per share just before the COVID-19 crisis made that same share worth less than $86. The company’s famous theme parks were devastated by the pandemic, but its digital division — which benefited from the launch of Disney+ — served as a hedge to those losses.  Netflix (NFLX): $22,773.20  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $22.09  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $503.06  Compound annual growth rate: 36.69%  In terms of stock prices, the pandemic has been kind to Netflix — presumably because it’s forced millions of people to spend way more time at home watching Netflix. By 2010, Netflix had shed its skin as a mail-order DVD movie subscription alternative and was positioning itself as a decade-dominating media giant.  Alphabet (GOOGL): $5,559.33  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $261.83  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $1,455.60  Compound annual growth rate: 18.71%  During the last 10 years, Google got so big that it had to restructure and create a parent company called Alphabet to serve as an umbrella over Google and its many subsidiaries.  Story continues  Apple (AAPL): $12,961.01  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $8.72  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $113.02  Compound annual growth rate: 29.2%  Apple is a consumer goods giant that rode the smartphone revolution to its status as one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a valuation that has cleared $1 trillion in the recent past.  Coca-Cola Company (KO): $2,392.63  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $20.63  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $49.36  Compound annual growth rate: 9.12%  Coke is an iconic brand and one of Warren Buffett’s favorite investments. However, the declining popularity of sugary soda drinks might be eating into the company’s profitability over the long run.  Take a Look: These Industries Will Make the Biggest Comeback from COVID-19  Walmart (WMT): $3,377.40  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $41.60  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $140.50  Compound annual growth rate: 12.94%  Walmart is the world’s biggest retailer, but unlike so many retailers that were struggling to compete with Amazon and the rest even before the pandemic, Walmart has adapted well and stayed profitable.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG): $15.63  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $51.17  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $0.80  Compound annual growth rate: -34.02%  It turns out being associated with one of the most catastrophic oil spills in history can have a negative effect on your shares. Thanks largely to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident, Transocean managed to whittle a $1,000 investment down to less than $20 in just 10 years.  Trex Company Inc. (TREX): $30,217.21  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $2.44  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $73.73  Compound annual growth rate: 40.61%  Trex Company makes wood/plastic composites used in outdoor decks — which, apparently, is a pretty great business to be in as the company has been growing at over 40% a year for the last decade. 2017 was the best year for Trex stock until 2020 — the company’s shareholders are riding high today.  Microsoft (MSFT): $10,672.36  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $19.32  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $206.19  Compound annual growth rate: 26.71%  Microsoft’s stock has performed quite well over the past few years, but that pales in contrast to its performance during the 1990s when it helped create a number of “Microsoft millionaires.” These days, it’s still considered one of the safest stocks you can invest in — especially for first-time investors.  Nike (NKE): $8,250.16  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $15.35  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $126.64  Compound annual growth rate: 23.49%  Nike continues to be an innovator and leader in the sports apparel and equipment industry. By sponsoring a number of high-profile athletes and teams, the Nike symbol is one of the most recognizable corporate logos in the world.  Options: 26 Smartest Ways To Invest Your Money During the Pandemic  General Electric (GE): $551.81  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $11.58  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $6.39  Compound annual growth rate: -5.77%  General Electric recovered nicely coming out of the Great Recession, but major missteps in 2014 and 2017 have turned it into a long-term underperformer.  Amazon (AMZN): $20,395.55  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $153.71  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $3,135.00  Compound annual growth rate: 35.19%  A $1,000 investment in Amazon would have provided a substantial return for the long-term investor — with that investment essentially increasing in size by over one-third each year for a decade. A leader in e-commerce, Amazon consistently adds new products and services for consumer and business customers — and its business model was perfectly poised to profit from a pandemic.  Pfizer (PFE): $991.28  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $36.70  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $36.38  Compound annual growth rate: -0.09%  Pfizer has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride over the last several years, briefly flirting in 2018 with its late-’90s/early-2000s glory. Since the summer of 2019, however, it’s been a jagged line of steep losses that were quickly gained back before soon being lost again.  SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): $3,557.92  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $93.83  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $333.84  Compound annual growth rate: 13.53%  Perhaps the easiest route to investing in stocks is simply to invest in ETFs that track major indices, like the world’s most famous eight-legged S&P 500 index fund. If you can’t beat the market — and almost no one can — why not join it?  McDonald’s (MCD): $4,016.41  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $55.44  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $222.67  Compound annual growth rate: 14.92%  McDonald’s stock has enjoyed a consistently steady rise over the last decade. It’s fared well during the COVID-19 crisis, as more and more financially struggling families have turned to its cheap, easily accessible and high-calorie food.  Starbucks (SBUX): $7,877.16  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $10.99  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $86.57  Compound annual growth rate: 22.92%  Starbucks investors enjoyed a meteoric rise when the company’s stock prices nearly doubled between the summer of 2018 and the summer of 2019. Much of that gain, however, was lost when the COVID-19 crisis struck and things like expensive coffee could no longer be justified by many struggling families.  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK): $185.10  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $21.07  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $3.90  Compound annual growth rate: -15.52%  A turbulent decade for energy prices was not kind to investors in Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corporation. Its stock used to trade for nearly $50 a share, but today, you can get a single share for $4 — and even get some change back.  Check Out: 20 Beaten-Down Stocks Likely To Bounce Back After COVID-19  FedEx (FDX): $3,249.30  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $78.54  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $255.20  Compound annual growth rate: 12.51%  After a decade of gains, FedEx stock prices cratered in the second half of 2018, but the pandemic — and the massive increase in package deliveries it stoked — has been good for shareholders. In the last six months, the stock has nearly returned to its high from the summer of 2018.  Oracle (ORCL): $2,468.74  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $23.83  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $58.83  Compound annual growth rate: 9.46%  Oracle hit a major milestone in late June 2017 when it finally surpassed its all-time high from 2000 prior to a steep sell-off in the midst of the tech bubble bursting, having traded below that level for over 15 years.  The Boeing Company (BA): $3,192.40  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $52.65  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $168.08  Compound annual growth rate: 12.31%  2017 was a year of extraordinary growth for Boeing, and the gains lasted for two years. Then the 737 Max scandal rattled the company before the COVID-19 crisis sent shares falling from nearly $340 to $95 in a little more than a month between February and March — it hasn’t yet come close to recovering since.  The Mosaic Company (MOS): $363.29  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $50.40  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $18.31  Compound annual growth rate: -9.63%  The Mosaic Company is a basic materials company that produces concentrated phosphate and potash fertilizers. Of course, in the last decade, Mosaic Company stock has just been producing a lot of disappointed investors, as it’s worth only a little more than one-third of what it was a decade ago.  Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI): $7,933.13  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $9.87  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $78.3  Compound annual growth rate: 23.01%  Activision roared from less than $11 a share at the start of 2010 to more than $80 by the fall of 2018. The stock then plummeted to less than $45 in early 2019 before catching fire yet again to regain most of its losses today.  Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL): $7,796.15  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $28.06  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $218.76  Compound annual growth rate: 22.8%  There’s no need to slap makeup on results like these, Estee Lauder’s annual return over the last decade might have investors blushing at how well they’ve done. The company grew at a rapid rate after the 2008 crash, and despite several hiccups, it’s now trading at its peak.  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM): $8,851.79  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $28.00  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $247.85  Compound annual growth rate: 24.37%  Salesforce.com has been extremely consistent with its impressive growth over the last decade, but never more so than in the last few months. The COVID-19 crash sent the company’s stock to a sub-$135 low in early April before roaring forward to its current price.  EnviroStar Inc. (EVI): $47,431.03  Share price Oct. 1, 2010: $0.58  Share price Oct. 2, 2020: $27.51  Compound annual growth rate: 47.1%  Formerly known as EnviroStar, EVI Industries distributes, leases and rents out equipment for laundry and dry cleaning operations. The biggest gains came in the last four years as the stock jumped from $4.36 a share in August 2016 to a peak of $47.40 almost exactly two years later.

This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: What $1,000 Invested in Stocks 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today']","['Here\'s the answer to the headline\'s question: The Home Depot (HD 2.02%) is a great dividend stock. Of course, ""great"" is a relative term; there are various ways to measure greatness. However, after scrutinizing Home Depot\'s dividend from multiple angles, it\'s truly better than most.  Don\'t worry about the jargon now -- we\'ll define as we go. But Home Depot stock gives investors a good dividend yield, has a low payout ratio, and has opportunity for growth. That\'s why it\'s great and why dividend investors should give it a look.  High dividend yield  Dividends are what you get paid as a shareholder. Dividend yield, however, contextualizes the payment. Maybe two stocks both pay $1 per share annually -- the exact same dividend. But one stock trades at $50 per share while the other trades at $100 per share. The dividend yield of the former is 2%, while the yield of the latter is just 1%. All other things being equal, one would obviously want the dividend with the higher yield.  Home Depot stock currently has a dividend yield of 2.1%. To be clear, there are higher-yielding dividend stocks out there. For example, The Coca-Cola Company and Pfizer have yields exceeding 3% and 4% respectively. However, the current dividend yield average for the S&P 500 is just 1.7%. This means Home Depot\'s dividend yield is above average.  The true value of a high-yield dividend stock comes from reinvesting dividends over the long haul. Brokerages can set this up to happen automatically, and it can greatly increase your overall return. Just consider what would have happened if you had reinvested your Home Depot dividends over the last ten years.  Low payout ratio  A high dividend yield is meaningless if the dividend has a reasonable risk of being reduced. One way to assess a dividend\'s safety is by looking at the company\'s payout ratio. This metric measures how much a company is paying in dividends relative to how much it\'s earning. The higher the payout ratio, the higher a percentage of earnings are being paid out as dividends.  Home Depot\'s payout ratio is a very comfortable 52% right now. This gives it plenty of buffer if earnings fall unexpectedly. For example, many companies paused or canceled dividends this year because of the unanticipated COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, Home Depot was not one of those companies.  Over the last ten years, Home Depot management has kept the payout ratio mostly between 40% and 50%. As earnings rise, it increases the dividend proportionately. Because of this, investors can expect this dividend to continue being paid and even go up over time, as long as the company continues to grow earnings.  Superior earnings growth  Home Depot has been annually raising its dividend by a double-digit percentage for a decade. In February the dividend was raised 10% to $1.50 per share per quarter, more than double what the company was paying out in 2016. If it can continue at this pace, the dividend could double yet again in the next seven years.  In order to support dividend growth, Home Depot needs to continue growing earnings. The company has done this with ease over the last ten years.  Earnings growth hasn\'t been a problem for Home Depot in 2020 either. Perhaps one of the surprising developments from the coronavirus was the growth of home-improvement retail. Most commerce was hurt with people stuck at home. But according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, sales in the building material, garden, and supplies category were up 11.4% year over year during the first eight months of 2020. This trails only e-commerce and grocery-retail growth.  As the top dog in the home-improvement space, Home Depot was a primary beneficiary of the consumer-behavior shift. Its sales were up 16% year over year through the first two quarters. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 12.5% over that span.  However, growth in 2020 presents a revenue headwind heading into 2021. It\'s possible some future sales were pulled forward; people had federal stimulus money and free time to knock projects off to-do lists. This could mean people are up to date with home repairs and will consequently spend less in coming quarters.  That said, Home Depot could have an earnings tailwind going into next year. The company has paid out $1.3 billion so far in 2020 in COVID-19-related labor expenses. Therefore, it\'s possible its EPS could climb as one-time coronavirus costs fall, even if sales fall slightly in 2021.  Given its rich dividend history and compelling metrics, Home Depot stock should be high on dividend investors\' lists.', ""The coronavirus pandemic led many companies to direct their employees to work remotely. Millions of workers accustomed to showing up each day at their offices had to make a major adjustment.  Investors will want to know how Home Depot (HD 2.02%) is benefiting from this significant change in people's lifestyles. Here are two specific ways that the company is gaining from the shift to remote working:  1. People working from home needed a dedicated workspace  Some people already had their home offices. However, many weren't so lucky. These people needed to modify existing spaces or add home additions to accommodate the change in working needs.  Moreover, with companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft giving employees the option to work from home longer term, and perhaps even permanently, people felt more inclined to make capital investments to add a home office.  Whether adding an office or modifying an existing space, Home Depot benefited as customers shop for the necessary supplies. This trend can partly explain the company's remarkable results in the most recent quarter in which revenue increased by 23.4% to reach $38 billion.  2. Working remotely is freeing up people to live in more affordable cities  Interestingly, among those with the luxury of working remotely many are likely on the higher end of the pay scale and some are working in a high cost-of-living city. With the prevalence of remote working, some are taking the opportunity to move to a city with a lower cost of living. For example, tech workers in San Francisco are finding that housing costs in nearby Sacramento are one-third of what they are in San Francisco. This could partly explain the surge in homeownership rates in the U.S in the recent quarter.  According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, home-ownership rates spiked in the second quarter of 2020 to 68.2% compared to the first-quarter rate of 65.3%. They are now at levels not seen since the housing crash of 2007. Admittedly, record-low interest rates had something to do with this as well as people looking for backyards for their children to play in. However, the trend toward working remotely has played an important role in stepping up the sale of homes.  While adding a home office will give a short-term boost to Home Depot revenue and profits, the increasing rate of home ownership is a longer-lasting benefit. That's because people who own a home rather than rent will spend more on maintaining their properties.  Shares of Home Depot are already up 30% year to date. The increase has led this consumer discretionary stock to be trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 2.6 and a price-to-earnings ratio of 26. Both are the highest levels the company has traded at in the last decade.  The market might be anticipating that the coronavirus pandemic caused shifts in the economy that will make Home Depot a better long-term investment. Regardless of the share price, people spending more time at home and getting more use out of their homes with the addition of a home office are likely to benefit Home Depot in the long run.""]","[""Procter & Gamble (PG 0.12%) and Costco Wholesale (COST 1.60%) perform fundamentally different functions. P&G produces personal care products, and Costco is one of its numerous retailers.  However, both are large-cap stocks supported by mature companies that deliver rising profits and steady dividend increases. Let's review both companies to see which investment offers more profit potential.  The state of Costco  Costco leads the warehouse retailing business, outselling its most direct competitors, Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale. It also holds its own against other major brick-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart and Target. Moreover, it competes successfully with Amazon, primarily by turning a combined physical store and online presence to its advantage.  Still, Costco's success comes down to member growth and retention. Memberships, which currently start at $60 per year, make up the overwhelming majority of the company's profits. This model has allowed the company to grow to 552 warehouses across 45 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. It also operates an additional 244 warehouses in 11 other countries on four different continents.  Due to its success, Costco is a relatively expensive stock. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has risen to about 39. In Costco's most recent quarter, earnings increased by nearly 27% from year-ago levels as the pandemic stoked sales of consumer staples. However, earnings for fiscal 2020 as a whole rose by just over 9% from 2019 levels. This is more in line with forecasts, which point to an expected 10% net income increase in each of the next two years.  Costco also offers a dividend, which it has increased every year since 2004. However, with the $2.80 per year payout yielding only about 0.73%, most buy this stock in hopes of gains.  How Procter & Gamble fares  Procter & Gamble remains a leading company in personal care products. For much of its 180-year history, brands such as Tide laundry detergent, Bounty paper towels, and Gillette razors produced tidy profits for the personal care giant.  For most of that time, Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive served as its most direct competitors. However, as e-commerce took off, upstart, internet-based operations could compete more effectively. Consequently, P&G could no longer depend on name recognition and control of shelf space to drive sales.  Under current CEO David S. Taylor, it has resembled a start-up in some respects, buying products like Native deodorant that have sold well online. Thus, despite selling mostly commoditized products, it continues to drive growth.  Its forward P/E ratio now stands at around 27. P&G predicted between 3% and 7% core earnings-per-share growth for the upcoming fiscal year. This is in line with analyst forecasts, which predict increases of just under 6% in fiscal 2021 and about 7% for fiscal 2022. Nonetheless, despite steady growth, the stock appears pricey.  Where P&G stands out is with its dividend. At a yield of about 2.2%, the dividend of just over $3.16 per year is not noteworthy. Nonetheless, thanks to the company's 64-year track record of dividend increases, it is a draw for income-oriented stockholders.  Costco or Procter & Gamble?  From a valuation perspective, both Costco and Procter & Gamble have elevated earnings multiples relative to their expected profit growth. However, if I had to choose one, I would give the edge to Costco. For one, even amid high demand for personal care products during the pandemic, Costco stock has outperformed Procter & Gamble shares in 2020.  Additionally, Procter & Gamble already operates in more than 180 countries. While that is an impressive feat that few companies have accomplished, it leaves P&G with few new markets to tap.  Conversely, Costco operates in only a few countries. Nonetheless, it has shown that it can succeed abroad despite cultural differences. This bodes well for its international expansion for many years to come.  Both companies appear positioned to continue their growth and hike their dividends annually. However, with faster profit growth and more room for expansion, Costco stock seems to offer a more lucrative value proposition despite its higher multiple."", ""Costco has existed in some form since 1976.

Costco\'s robust traffic levels, underappreciated e-commerce network and sustainable gross margin expansion should continue to drive shares higher, Barclays said in a note to clients Tuesday. The firm upgraded the retailer\'s stock to an overweight rating, and raised its target price from $330 to $400. The new target is roughly 11% above where shares closed on Monday. Analyst Karen Short said that several gross margin tailwinds that have benefited Costco recently are poised to continue, including fewer promotions and lower markdowns. Costco has traditionally lowered prices in an effort to attract more customers, but as Covid-19 lingers, Short said, the company is preserving some of these gross margin-enhancing initiatives while things remain in flux. ""Once more of a return to \'normal\' is realized, COST will reinvest in price to drive more business and subsequently bring down gross margin — although to a higher rate than previously expected due to the stickiness of some sales leverage and the recovery of the ancillary businesses,"" she said. ""Traffic has always been robust at COST and the very quick rebound from trough levels at the peak of Covid has been remarkable,"" added Short. The company reported fourth quarter earnings on Sept. 24 that beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines. Shares have gained 22% this year, far surpassing the S & P 500\'s 5.5% gain.

Yahoo Finance first reported in July on the company’s entry into a category dominated for years by blue boxes sold by Kraft Heinz.  The launch isn’t as bizarre as it would seem at first blush. PepsiCo is no stranger to hawking packaged food — it has long sold Rice-a-Roni boxed rice and Aunt Jemima syrup under its Quaker Oats division.  Johnston said back in the summer the introduction was borne from PepsiCo studying new consumer eating trends amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The bet appears to be paying early dividends, and now has executives at the company thinking about ways to capitalize.  Said Johnston Thursday morning, “We literally can’t make enough. So every box we make, we’re selling almost immediately. And I expect over time we’ll be adding a lot of capacity. We think this is a big new idea.”  PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston holds up a box of its latest creation — Cheetos Mac 'n Cheese.  That said, it’s not as if PepsiCo needs mac and cheese to make its quarterly numbers. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has added a lot of costs to the businesses of Big Food, PepsiCo blew away analyst earnings estimates again in the third quarter. The company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.66 and net sales of $18.09 billion, beating estimates of $1.49 per share and net sales of $17.23 billion.  Sales were powered by demand for the aforementioned Rica-a-Roni, Tostitos, Quaker Oats oatmeal, Gatorade and the core Pepsi soda business.  PepsiCo shares rose 1% in Thursday afternoon trading.

That was the key takeaway from the beverage titan's fiscal third-quarter report this past week.  The announcement showed encouraging progress at stemming sales declines and slashing costs. But other worrying signs for Coke investors included market-share losses and the prospect of near zero growth well into 2021.  Sales check-in  Sales declines moderated to 9% compared to the 28% slump Coke endured during the peak social distancing months of April and May. The company's 4% volume decline also marked a solid improvement from the second quarter's 16% dive .  But Coke is still losing market share. PepsiCo (PEP -0.43%) notched a 1% volume boost in Q3 in its beverage division and boosted organic revenue by 4% overall. Coke's comparable metric was a 6% decline.  Executives said Coke lost ground in its core product segments due to the global weakness in away-from-home channels like the restaurants, theme parks, sports, and music venues that make up most of its business. Those comments echoed their late July prediction that a full rebound might be several years away.  Sparkling finances  The news was better around the financial metrics that Coke can influence even as demand in its biggest markets is severely disrupted. CEO James Quincey and his team slashed costs and even managed higher prices in the U.S. These wins allowed adjusted operating margin to rise to 30.4% of sales from 28.1%. As a result, adjusted earnings only fell 2% compared to the 9% drop in reported revenue.  Coke continued to generate plenty of cash, but that metric also showed signs of stress from COVID-19. Free cash flow is down 17% so far in 2020, to $5.5 billion. Pepsi's cash, in contrast, is up 29% to $4.1 billion .  A flat outlook  Coke didn't issue an official outlook in another contrast with Pepsi, which recently predicted growth that will be close to 2019's strong result. The beverage giant doesn't have the benefit of a huge consumer food division to offset weakness in the drink segment, after all. And within its beverage segment, sales are tilted toward on-the-go niches.  That positioning helps explain why Coke provided some hints that point to more soft demand trends into 2021. While volumes have been improving for months, the rate of improvement is slowing, said management. Sales are still running lower in the low single digits in October.  The company has plenty of levers it can keep pulling to protect earnings and cash flow. And there are promising new product launches on the way, too, including its hard seltzer brand set to hit the U.S. market in early 2021.  But the latest results should have investors bracing for several more quarters of unusually weak sales and market-share results while most consumer mobility remains far lower than it was before the pandemic disrupted global social behaviors."", 'Lockdowns and stay-at-home restrictions have helped in driving huge demand for snacks and beverages since the pandemic began. However, the fall in consumption in the away-from-home channels and supply chain disruptions had a notable impact on snack food and beverage companies.  The spike in at-home channel sales moderated in the third quarter but the demand for snacks, packaged food and beverages continues to be better than pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 fears are impacting on-premise consumption.  Against this backdrop of changing dynamics, we will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to place Mondelez International and PepsiCo alongside each other and see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.  Mondelez International (MDLZ)  Mondelez is one of the largest snack companies and is known globally for its brands like Oreo, belVita, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Toblerone and Trident gum. It has been enhancing its snack offerings through continued innovation and strategic acquisitions.  In July, the company acquired a majority interest in Give & Go, a sweet baked goods maker and owner of the Two-Bite Brownies and the Create-A-Treat brands. Mondelez acquired a majority stake in Perfect Snacks, which has a strong presence in the refrigerated nutrition bars segment, in 2019 and Tate’s Bake Shop, a premium cookie and baked goods brand, in 2018.  The pandemic has adversely impacted Mondelez’s world travel retail sales, away-from-home channel and the traditional trade channel in certain key emerging markets. The gum category was severely dragged down by a drop in on-the-go consumption.  In 2Q, revenue declined 2.5% Y/Y to $5.9 billion even as the company’s North America business grew 17.3% to $2.0 billion. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures, the company’s organic revenue grew 0.7%.  Despite the weakness in the top-line, 2Q adjusted EPS grew 12.5% to $0.63 due to the company’s cost-containment efforts. In its 2Q conference call, Mondelez stated that it maintained or gained share in markets that represent about 85% of its year-to-date revenue. The company also said that overall business was trending better in July than in 2Q and it expects a sequential improvement in 3Q.  Story continues  In the first half of the year, Mondelez generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion. In July, the company announced about an 11% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.315.  As part of its efforts to reduce its costs and streamline its supply chain, the company is removing 25% of SKUs (stock keeping unit). The company intends to redirect its cost savings to brand-building efforts.  Focus on the e-commerce channel is also a key priority for the company, especially when consumers are increasingly shopping online for groceries amid the pandemic. E-commerce sales grew 91% in 2Q and accounted for 6% of the company’s 2Q revenue, up from 3.5% in 1Q.  After several back-to-back Buy ratings in recent months, Mondelez was downgraded on Thursday by Guggenheim analyst Laurent Grandet to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $60. The analyst feels that the current valuation reflects the expected future revenue growth potential of about 3% to 4%, which is below some peers.  However, the analyst continues to believe that “Mondelez is a best-in-class US food company and, while it isn’t benefiting as much as peers during the pandemic due to the nature of its categories, we expect it to continue capturing global snack market share in the years ahead.” (See MDLZ stock analysis on TipRanks)  Meanwhile, the rest of the Street is bullish about Mondelez. A Strong Buy consensus is based on 12 Buys versus 1 Hold and no Sells. The stock has risen 5.9% year-to-date and the average analyst price target of $63.17 indicates an upside potential of 8.3% from the current levels.  PepsiCo (PEP)  PepsiCo’s snack food business, especially Frito Lay North America, has helped it in mitigating weakness in soda beverages over recent years as consumers are shifting to healthier options. The snack food and beverage giant has an extensive portfolio of brands, including 23 brands (like Frito-Lay, Cheetos, Doritos, Gatorade, Pepsi, Quaker and Tropicana) that generate over $1 billion each in estimated annual retail sales.  The COVID-19 pandemic hurt the company’s sales from the away-from-channels like restaurants. However, the situation improved in the third quarter. PepsiCo’s 3Q revenue increased 5.3% Y/Y to $18.1 billion while organic revenue growth was 4.2%. Adjusted EPS grew 6.4% to $1.66.  Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods North America divisions delivered organic revenue growth of 6% each as at-home food consumption continued to be strong amid rising COVID cases. PepsiCo Beverages North America division posted organic revenue growth of 3%.  With the exception of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia division, the company experienced organic growth in all its international divisions. PepsiCo now expects organic revenue growth of about 4% and a 0.5% decline in its adjusted EPS in 2020.  Nonetheless, the company continues to expand its presence in growth areas. Earlier this year, PepsiCo acquired Rockstar Energy and entered into an agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals for the exclusive distribution of Bang Energy drinks in the US in line with its strategy to expand in the energy drinks market.  It also acquired Be & Cheery, one of the largest online snacks companies in China. PepsiCo is improving its visibility and scale in its e-commerce business, which almost doubled in 3Q.  The company continues to focus on the innovation of healthier snack food and beverage categories. PepsiCo stated that Gatorade Zero, Bubly and Mountain Dew Zero Sugar together delivered over $1 billion in retail sales on a year-to-date basis. The company is also expanding the presence of Pepsi Zero Sugar, which has seen over 30% retail sales growth year-to-date.  PepsiCo is a dividend aristocrat (a company that has hiked dividends for at least 25 consecutive years) and raised its annualized dividend this year to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share. This year marks the 48th consecutive year of dividend rise.  On Oct.12, Citi analyst Wendy Nicholson upgraded PepsiCo to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $169 from $148. The analyst believes that PepsiCo\'s earnings growth can accelerate next year and its relative multiple can ""expand considerably from current levels.""  The analyst noted that PepsiCo has delivered the most consistent organic sales growth when compared to fellow mega-caps Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble. Nicholson also says that while Pepsi has a lower operating margin than its peers, it has the largest potential to expand its operating margin in coming years. (See PEP stock analysis on TipRanks)  The Street is cautiously optimistic on PepsiCo stock. A Moderate Buy consensus is based on 6 Buys versus 5 Holds and no Sells. The stock has risen 3.5% so far in 2020 and could rise 7.7% in the coming months as indicated by the average analyst price target of $152.27.  Conclusion  Both Mondelez and PepsiCo have strong brands and extensive international presence. Mondelez has a dividend yield of 2.15% compared to PepsiCo’s yield of 2.87%. However, Mondelez stock has fared better than PepsiCo so far this year and has slightly more upside potential as indicated by the current average analyst price target. With a lower valuation as well as a more bullish Street consensus, Mondelez appears to be a better stock than PepsiCo right now.

It dropped on Tuesday after Apple warned on its earnings call growth in the September quarter would not be as strong as June\'s.

However, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said Apple expects double-digit, year-over-year growth in the current quarter. Maestri said that Apple expected less than 36% growth in the September quarter because of foreign exchange rates, less growth in its services business and supply constraints for iPhones and iPads.  Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a call with analysts that Apple is seeing supply constraints related to ""silicon"" (a common term for computer chips) that would affect the company\'s iPhone and iPad sales in the September quarter.  Apple also had a strong quarter in its Greater China region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong in addition to the mainland. Apple reported $14.76 billion in sales in the region, up 58% from the same quarter last year, although it was an easy comparison given that China was in stages of lockdown during the quarter.  Americas sales were up nearly 33% year-over-year to $39.57 billion.', ""Apple (AAPL) reached a significant support level, and could be a good pick for investors from a technical perspective. Recently, AAPL broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.  The 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.  Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.  Moving Average Chart for AAPL  AAPL has rallied 6.1% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests AAPL could be on the verge of another move higher.  Once investors consider AAPL's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has been lowered in the past two months, compared to 10 raised estimates, for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has increased as well.  Investors should think about putting AAPL on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, Apple is reporting a very strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth across our product and services categories and in every geographic segment. We set a new June quarter revenue record of $81.4 billion, up 36% from last year, and the vast majority of markets we track grew double digits, with especially strong growth in emerging markets, including India, Latin America, and Vietnam.  Total retail sales also set a June quarter record, and almost all of our retail stores have now opened their doors. This quarter saw a growing sense of optimism from consumers in the United States and around the world, driving renewed hope for a better future and for all that innovation can make possible. But as the last 18 months have demonstrated many times before, progress made is not progress guaranteed. An uneven recovery to the pandemic and a Delta variant surging in many countries around the world have shown us once again that the road to recovery will be a winding one.  In the midst of that enduring adversity, we are especially humbled that our technology has continued to play a key role in keeping our customers connected. Just last month, it was great to be back with our teams and customers for the opening of our newest retail store in Los Angeles, Apple Tower Theatre. It was a hopeful reminder of the energy and sense of community shared spaces bring and how appreciative we all are now of the simple privilege of talking to one another face to face. As we look forward to more in-person interactions in the future, we're doubling down on innovation and doing all we can to help chart a course to a healthier and more equitable world.  I'll have more to say about our work in those areas a bit later on. But first, let's turn to our product and services categories. For iPhone, this quarter saw very strong double-digit growth in each geographic segment, and we continue to be heartened by our customers' response to the iPhone 12 lineup. We're only in the early innings of 5G, but already its incredible performance and speed have made a significant impact on how people can get the most out of our technology.  Customers love iPhone 12 for its superfast 5G speeds, A14 bionic chip, and Adobe vision camera never seen before in a phone. Users continue to rely on iPad and Mac to work, learn, create and connect. iPad had its highest June quarter in nearly a decade, while Mac set an all-time June quarter record. We've seen a great response to the new iMac and iPad Pro, both powered by the M1 chip's exceptional speed and power-efficient performance.  The iMac's remarkable thin design and vibrant colors have made it a favorite for users everywhere. And the iPad continues to be an incredibly versatile tool in our users' toolbox, inspiring creativity and connection and keeping us entertained and productive in equal measure. It was another very strong quarter for wearables, home, and accessories, which set a new June quarter record while helping people find more ways to stay entertained, healthy, and connected at home and on the go. Apple Watch remains a go-to choice for users to stay on top of their health and reach their fitness goals.  And our newest accessory AirTag began shipping to an enthusiastic response from customers, making the Find My network more useful than ever while protecting user privacy. Turning to services, which set a new all-time revenue record as we continue to roll out innovative new features and programming. We're proud to be the recipients of 35 Emmy nominations this year, which speaks to the quality of our programming and an enthusiastic reception from customers and critics alike. Apple TV+ users are loving series like Mythic Quest and anticipating groundbreaking films like CODA, which premieres next month.  And of course, Ted Lasso kicked off season two just last week and continues to win over viewers with its heartwarming message about the power of community, compassion, and hope. We also introduced Apple Podcasts subscriptions, a global marketplace for users to discover exclusive content and support their favorite creators. And we launched spatial audio for Apple Music, a cinematic listening experience that promises to change how music fans listen and musicians create even more immersive, layered, and beautiful songs. Last month, we shared many exciting new features at WWDC, but more powerful than any of them was the incredible showing of developers from all walks of life and around the world.  The new tools we announced will help developers harness cutting-edge technologies like augmented reality, reach new users, and customize their experience on the App Store, are learned to update or invent an app with Swift, Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language. Today's investments in education and coding translate to tomorrow's small businesses and groundbreaking new apps, the next app -- the next act of an app economy already creating jobs and opportunities around the world. In June, a new study by the Analysis Group found that it was another record year for App Store developers whose combined billings and sales increased by 24% to $643 billion in 2020. The app economy continues to be an incredible engine of prosperity and opportunity fueled by the ceaseless striving of developers to make apps that enrich people's lives.  Much like the developer community, we are diehard optimists about technology's potential to help people live happier, healthier, and more fulfilled lives, goals that shine through with powerful new updates coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS this fall. That begins with innovative new features that help users stay connected with one another, like SharePlay and spatial audio for FaceTime or disconnect when they need a break, like Focus, which limits distracting notifications when you're winding down for bed or concentrating at work. And new productivity features make iPad an even more useful tool for multitasking, helping users navigate across apps, split their screen, or use Quick Note to capture a thought the moment inspiration strives. In the health space, our new health sharing feature will make it easier than ever to securely share your health data with loved ones.  That includes new capabilities like walking steadiness, which uses sensors to assess user stability doing everyday task and recommends exercises to improve stability and avoid a fall. In the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right, we shared new features in iOS 15 that continue to drive our progress forward from mail privacy protection, which stops invisible pixels and an email from tracking your mail activity, to app privacy report, which helps users check on the apps they've granted permission to use their personal data. We also introduced some incredible next-generation technologies coming to the accessibility space, from assistive touch, which helps people with limb differences navigate Apple Watch to new voiceover capabilities to help blind and low-vision users. Accessibility remains a bedrock principle for us in the simple belief that the best technology for the world should be the best technology for everyone.  But the responsibility to be a force for good in the lives of others extends beyond the technology we make, so to the teachers and students shaping our future. This quarter, as part of our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, we awarded innovation grants to engineering schools at four historically black colleges and universities to expand their coursework, scholarships, and internship opportunities in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. We see education as a great equalizing force, and we're more dedicated than ever to supporting the educators, advocates, and students lighting the path and leading the way. That includes the 350 Swift Student Challenge winners we recognized at this year's WWDC.  If you ever need a dose of hope or inspiration, I can't say enough about our student scholarship winners whose apt bring so much good into the world, from teaching other young people to code to helping volunteers deliver groceries to people at high risk of COVID-19. Young people's innovations remind us that our collective future is bound up in the next generation's passion for solving global challenges and of the responsibility we have to join them in building a better world. Turning to our own backyard, we're continuing to press forward in our efforts to help bring more affordable housing to the Bay Area and across California. This month, we shared that we've contributed more than $1 billion to help first-time homeowners and construct thousands of new affordable housing units across the state.  And we're continuing to stay focused on supporting the global response to the pandemic and delivering the best products and services for people. Our greatest source of inspiration isn't technology itself but how people use it in their own lives in ways great and small: to write a novel or to read one; to care for an ailing patient or see a doctor virtually; to track their heart rate on a jog or to train for the Olympics. Every day, I'm grateful for the dedication of our teams to the simple mission of creating technology that improves people's lives. And I want to thank everyone at Apple for the purpose and passion they bring to that mission.  With that, I'll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter.  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record June quarter financial results, which reflect the importance of our products and services in our customers' lives and our strong underlying operating performance. Our revenue reached a June quarter record of $81.4 billion, an increase of nearly $22 billion or 36% from a year ago.  We grew double digits in each of our product categories with an all-time record for Services and June quarter records for iPhone, Mac and wearables, home, and accessories. We also set new June quarter records in every geographic segment with very strong double-digit growth in each one of them. Products revenue was a June quarter record of $63.9 billion, up 37% over a year ago. This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers, drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record.  Our services set an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion, up 33% over a year ago with June quarter records in each geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.3%, up 80 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 36%, down 10 basis points sequentially, as seasonal loss of leverage was almost entirely offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 69.8%, down 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.  Net income of $21.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.30, and operating cash flow of $21.1 billion were all June quarter records by a wide margin. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a June quarter record of $39.6 billion, growing 50% year over year and exceeding our own expectations as the iPhone 12 family continues to be in very high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world, and we grew very strong double digits in each geographic segment, setting June quarter records in most markets we track.  Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and the strength of our ecosystem. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 97% for the iPhone 12 family. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising, and payment services and June quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare.  Our newer service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content, and features and are contributing to overall services growth. The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction. First, our installed base of devices reached an all-time high across each geographic segment. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter in each geographic segment, and paid accounts increased double digits.  Third, paid subscriptions continue to show strong growth. We now have more than 700 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 150 million from last year and nearly four times the number of paid subscriptions we had only four years ago. And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. For example, during WWDC in June, we previewed our new iCloud+ and Apple Wallet features, which we believe will create a more secure and differentiated customer experience.  Wearables, home, and accessories grew 36% year over year to $8.8 billion, setting new June quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category. This quarter, we began shipping our new Apple TV 4K with a redesigned Siri Remote and our brand-new AirTags, and the customer response to both products has been very strong. In addition to its outstanding sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.  For Mac, despite supply constraints, we set a June quarter record of $8.2 billion, up 16% over last year, with June quarter revenue records in most markets we track around the world. It is remarkable that the last four quarters for Mac have been its best four quarters ever. This exceptional level of sales success has been driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip, which we most recently brought to our newly redesigned iMac. iPad performance was also strong with revenue of $7.4 billion, up 12% in spite of significant supply constraints.  During the quarter, we also starting shipping our new iPad Pro powered by the M1 chip, and customer response has been outstanding. Both iPad and Mac have taken computing to the next level, and when you combine their performance over the last 12 months, they are now the size of a Fortune 50 business thanks to the best product lineups we've ever had, very high levels of customer satisfaction and a loyal growing installed base. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product, and in most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 92% for Mac and 95% for iPad.  In enterprise, our customers are excited about the superior performance, battery life, and security that the new M1 Macs bring. MassMutual, for example, is offering M1 MacBook Pro to all of its employees and equipping all conference rooms with M1 Mac Minis in preparation for return to work. And with its incredible performance and affordable entry price, the MacBook Air with M1 is gaining rapid adoption among many leading enterprise organizations. Italgas, Italy's largest natural gas company, which will soon be using its extensive network to distribute renewable gases, is replacing every employee's Windows laptop with the new MacBook Air powered by Apple's M1 chip to bring the latest technology to its workforce.  And Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app that provides transportation, food delivery and digital payment services, is adding M1 MacBook Air to its companywide M1 Mac deployment. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and increased commercial paper by $3 billion, leaving us with total debt of $122 billion.  As a result, net cash was $72 billion at the end of the quarter. As our business continued to perform at a very high level, we are also able to return $29 billion to shareholders during the June quarter. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $17.5 billion through open market repurchases of 136 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 32 million shares.  As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect very strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. We expect revenue growth to be lower than our June quarter year-over-year growth of 36% for three reasons.  First, we expect the foreign exchange impact on our year-over-year growth rate to be three points less favorable than it was during the June quarter. Second, we expect our services growth rate to return to a more typical level. The growth rate during the June quarter benefited from a favorable compare as certain services were significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns a year ago. And third, we expect supply constraints during the September quarter to be greater than what we experienced during the June quarter.  The constraints will primarily impact iPhone and iPad. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect opex to be between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around zero, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.  Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on August 12, 2021, to shareholders of record as of August 9, 2021. With that, let's open the call to questions.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thank you, Luca. [Operator instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?  Questions & Answers:  Operator  Thank you. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hello, Katy.  Your line is open. Please check your mute function. Hearing no response, we'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.  Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst  Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Just to dig into the commentary on guidance a little bit.  Just starting with the fact that last year, obviously, there was a later launch of iPhone than we've typically seen in other years. Could you talk us through that and perhaps some of the other products, what may be different as compared to last year?  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  Well, as I explained, there are -- first of all, we are expecting to grow very strong double digits. That's, I think, Chris, the starting point here. We expect this very strong level of growth that we've experienced during the course of the year to continue into the September quarter. We said that the growth rate is going to be below 36%, and I've listed three factors.  The first factor is that the dollar continues to be favorable on a year-over-year basis in the sense that it's weakened against most currencies on a year-over-year basis, but that benefit is going to be about three points less in the September quarter than what we've experienced during the June quarter because the dollar strengthened against most currencies in recent weeks. Second, I mentioned that the services growth rate that we've experienced in the June quarter, 33%, that's significantly higher than what we've had in recent history. And that was due to the fact that there were a couple of services categories, namely our advertising business and AppleCare that were significantly impacted a year ago because of the COVID lockdowns, and therefore, they had a relatively easy compare in the June quarter. And so we don't expect that to continue into the September quarter.  And so we expect still significant growth in services, but not to the level that we've seen in June. And then I mentioned that the supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher during the September quarter. Back in -- when we talked here three months ago, we said that we were expecting supply constraints for the June quarter between $3 billion and $4 billion to affect primarily iPad and Mac. We were able to mitigate some of those constraints during the June quarter.  And so we came in at a number that was slightly below the low end of that range that we had quoted at the beginning of the quarter, but we expect that number to be higher for the September quarter. And so when you put all that together, again, very strong double-digit growth for September, with these caveats that I just mentioned.  Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst  If I could follow up with regard to the supply constraints, and do you expect those supply constraints to persist through the December quarter as well what effect will that have on the holiday selling season? And then in conjunction with that, what additional costs are you absorbing because of these supply constraints? Is that having an effect on gross margins or just product cost in general as you perhaps pay a little more to get more supply?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Chris, it's Tim. In terms of the cost, we're paying more for freight than I would like to pay, but component costs continue in the aggregate to decline. In terms of supply constraints and how long they will last, I don't want to predict that today. We're going to take it sort of one quarter at a time.  And as you would guess, we'll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt.  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  And, Chris, on the cost side, as I mentioned during my comments, our results for gross margins for the June quarter, 43.3%, we really saw some really nice cost savings during the quarter. And I think you've seen that we provided guidance of 41.5% to 42.5% for September, which is obviously a level that we are very pleased with.  Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst  Right. Thank you.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thank you, Chris. Can we have the next questions, please?  Operator  We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. Please go ahead.  Jim Suva -- Citi -- Analyst  Thank you very much, and congratulations to you and your global team for great operations during a challenging time. Tim and Luca, I just have one question and either of you or both of you could figure out who's best to answer it. But we look at a world of pretty unprecedented, whether it be COVID, the Delta variant, China flood, supply chain components, just wondering for your like R&D and innovation, is it being materially impacted by that such where a normal cadence is unfair? Or is it kind of happening during a slow time of year where you're able to empower people to work remotely and still have the typical innovations and product launches that you've had historically in the past?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Jim, the company has been incredibly resilient. The employees are really doing double duty. And I could not be more pleased with the cadence that we're coming out with new things. As you can see from the software announcements that we made in -- at WWDC and the corresponding launches of the software that we plan on in the fall and then all of the products that we've been able to bring out over the last 12 to 18 months, it's amazing.  And so I'm very pleased with it.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?  Jim Suva -- Citi -- Analyst  Congratulations again.  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Thanks, Jim.  Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst  Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research LLC -- Analyst  Thank you very much. Tim, I'm curious, what have you learned from this iPhone cycle regarding customer preferences and pricing and maybe subscriptions in that? And if there is a difference, if you could talk about it on a geographic basis. Thanks.  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  We've -- if you look at our results in Q3, Shannon, we had strong double-digit growth for switchers and for upgraders. And in fact, it was our largest upgrade quarter for a Q3 ever. And so we feel really, really great about both categories. And as Luca kind of said during the preamble or opening comments, we -- our results are really strong for iPhone around the world.  And so it's been a very, very strong cycle. And yet we're -- the penetration on 5G is obviously still very, very low. And so we feel really good about the future of the iPhone.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research LLC -- Analyst  OK. And maybe if you can talk a bit about China, up 58%, where are you seeing the growth? What are you hearing from customers there? How is this -- actually, 58% is not sustainable, but how sustainable is the strength?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  It was an incredibly strong quarter. It set a June quarter revenue record for Greater China for us, and so we're very proud of that and doing the best job we can to serve customers there. We had a particularly strong response to the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. Those results were particularly strong.  And if -- but if you look at the balance of our products, we also set June quarter records for wearables, home, and accessories for Mac and for services. So it was sort of an across-the-board strength. And we're seeing plenty of new customers come to the market. For example, Mac and iPad, about two-thirds of the customers who bought in the last quarter were new to that product.  For the Apple Watch, that number was 85%. And so we could not be happier with the results.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research LLC -- Analyst  Was the 85% China or overall?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  85% was China. Yes. I was talking about, specifically, the numbers I referenced were specifically for China.  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  And then, Shannon, for the world, the Watch is 75%.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research LLC -- Analyst  Right. Great. Thank you so much.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Yes. Thanks, Shannan. Can we have the next question, please?  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.  Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst  Perfect. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off, Luca, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the gross margins and maybe the expectations you laid out for September.  I think sequentially, it implies it's down a hundred basis points or so. So maybe just touch on what are the puts and takes there would be helpful because I think historically, September tends to be flattish, maybe even up a little bit gross margin number for you folks.  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  Yes. I think it's important to go back to the Q3 results. Right? It's 43.3%. And one of the things that I mentioned is that in addition to getting really good cost savings on a sequential basis, we also had a very high mix of services as part of the total, and particularly, with advertising doing really, really well because of the rebound that we saw from the COVID lockdowns a year ago.  And so as we move forward sequentially, we do expect a different mix, and so that drives the guidance that we provided, which, again, as you know, it's significantly higher than just a year ago. For example, a year ago, we were at 38.2%, so almost 400 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis. Right? And so I think it's important to take that into account, just a different mix.  Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst  Got it. No. Absolutely. I don't think anyone expected gross margins to be north of 40% just quickly for you, folks.  So that is impressive. If I could follow up on Services, and I know you called out the 33% growth this quarter as a bit of an aberration. The compares were easier. But as you look at your services growth rate over the last four quarters, let's just say, what do you think is enabling this growth? Is it you're able to have a higher ARPU more monetization of your installed base? Or is your installed base growing? I'm curious, which one is bigger? And then over time, how do you think those two components stack up for you?  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  It's a combination of multiple factors. Right? Obviously, the fact that our installed base continues to grow and it sets new all-time highs all the time obviously gives us a larger opportunity all the time. And second, we have more and more people that are engaged in our ecosystem, both transacting for free, which is a very large number, and people that are willing to pay for some of the services, and that percentage of people that are paying for our services continues to grow nicely. I mentioned it grew double digits again this quarter.  So that obviously helps on the revenue side. And, of course, we continue to increase both the quality and the quantity of the services. As you know, during the last few years, we've launched a lot of new services from Apple TV+ to Fitness+, Apple Arcade, News+ and so -- and of course, the Apple Card. And so these are businesses that we are scaling right now.  And so all that additional revenue helps, and I think it flows through our growth rates. As you said, during the last four quarters, we are well into the mid-20s. Right? So I think it's obviously very nice for us to see.  Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst  Perfect. Thank you.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?  Operator  Thank you. We'll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.  Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me OK?  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Yes. We can.  Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  OK. Good. So first question, there's a debate in the market around how much Apple benefited from the pandemic, given increased spend in areas like Mac and App Store. But of course, you've mentioned over the past several quarters that there are other areas that were limited by the pandemic and store closures, and less foot traffic.  When you net out all the puts and takes, was your business helped? Or was it hindered by the pandemic?  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  Well, of course, Katy, we don't have the crystal ball that tells us exactly what these different variables, how they impacted our business. We do know that on -- I would say, on the positive side of the ledger, obviously, especially during the periods of extreme lockdowns, digital services did very well because entertainment options were limited. And so obviously, our digital services did really, really well. Obviously, with more people working from home, more people studying from home, we know that iPad and Mac demand was very, very strong.  On the other side, we had certain services like advertising because of the reduced economic activity, AppleCare because our stores were closed, that were affected negatively, and certain products like the iPhone or the Watch. So there are maybe more complex types of sales because of the complexity of the transaction. They were also affected because so many points of sale were closed all around the world, not only our stores but also our partner stores. Right? So we had that dynamic during -- throughout COVID.  And now some of these businesses are rebounding. I mentioned advertising and AppleCare. iPad and Mac, it's difficult for us to gauge because we've been constrained for quite a long period of time. And the reality is that maybe the new normal after we exit COVID may be different from the past.  For example, maybe there's going to be hybrid models around work, for example. And so it's difficult to tell you on a net basis what that is, clearly -- and this is very fluid because it tends to change over time. I can certainly tell you that we're all looking forward to a COVID-free world. I think that would be very good for us and for the entire -- I mean, for our customers as well.  Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  And just a follow-up on iPhone specifically. If you look historically after a really strong product cycle, which you've experienced this year with iPhone 12, iPhone revenues come under pressure because the upgrade rate slows, the mix often shifts to the lower end of the portfolio. Is it fair to assume a similar trend will play out over the next year? Or if not, what do you think is different this time?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Katy, it's Tim. We're not predicting the next cycle, but I would point out a few things. One is we have a very large and growing installed base. As you know, we've -- the iPhones passed a billion active devices earlier this year.  Two, we have loyal and satisfied customers. The customer set that we're seeing on the new iPhones are -- is just amazing. It's jaw-dropping. And the geographic response is pervasive across the world.  And in the U.S., we had the top three selling models. In the U.K., we have four out of the top five. In Australia, we have the top two. In Japan, we have the top three.  In Urban China, we have the top two. And so the response from customers all around have been great. Obviously, the product itself is amazing. The 12 lineup was a huge leap that introduced 5G and had A14 Bionic and a number of other fantastic features that customers love.  The next thing I think to consider is that we're in the very early innings of 5G. If you look at 5G penetration around the world, there's only a couple of countries that are in the double-digits yet. And so that's an amazing thing nine months or so into this. And the last thing is we're going to continue to deliver great products.  We're going to continue to do what we do best is integrate hardware, software, and services together into an amazing experience. And so those are the things that I would consider if I were coming up with forecast.  Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  That's great color. Thank you.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?  Operator  We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.  Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst  Yes. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations. Fantastic execution.  It's resulted in consistency for your results. Tim, this is actually perfect timing for this question. You talked about your installed base of a billion-odd units. I was curious if you could help us understand how old that installed base is.  And the reason that I'm asking this question is we're clearly seeing people upgrade to 5G phones. And if that's the case and that continues, that could be a larger force than most other forces for your revenues to continue to grow as people migrate to the 5G family of phones. So I was curious if you could shed light on how the upgrades are happening and then also how old that base is.  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Yes. What I would say is it's -- first of all, it's difficult to answer your question precisely. But what I would tell you is on both switchers and upgraders, we did extremely well in Q3. Both were up strong double digits.  And the geographic representation of iPhone year-over-year comps were -- looks extremely well. And so we're really pleased with it. I would remind you that the billion number that I quoted also was iPhone, where we quoted a number earlier in the year in the January call, I believe, of 1.65 billion devices is the total active devices just for clarification. And so the net is very strong switchers, very strong upgraders, best upgrade quarter for June -- for the June quarter that we've seen.  And we feel really great about the momentum. But at the same time, we recognize that the 5G penetration is quite low around the world and very, very low. We're at the front end of this.  Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst  Fair enough. For my follow-up, Apple is probably one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. How do you -- how does Apple determine what's strategic and something that Apple wants to make itself versus non-strategic? And also, I was curious, there's a lot of -- well, it's public news now that Arm is getting acquired by NVIDIA, and I was curious how Apple views that. Is that something that's beneficial to Apple or not meaningful or negative?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Well, I think that that acquisition has lots of questions that people are asking, and I'll sort of leave that up to everyone else. And in terms of us and how we decide to make silicon, we ask ourselves if we can do something better, if we can deliver a better product, if we can buy something in the market and it's great and it's as good as what we could do, we're going to buy it. We'll only enter where we believe we have an ability to do something better and therefore, make a better product for the user. And so the M1 is a great example of that.  We have the ability within our silicon team to deliver a product that we feel is appreciably better than we could buy. And so we've taken our great hardware and software expertise and combine those and have brought the M1 out. And the response to the M1 has been unbelievable. It's powering Mac sales that are constrained.  It's powering now iPad, which also has constraints on it. And so that's how we look at whether we should enter a market or not.  Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst  Thank you.  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Thanks for the question.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?  Operator  Certainly. We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.  Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst  Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. First one for Luca, you mentioned Services growth should normalize in the September quarter.  And I understand the last few quarters, Services business was strong, driven by work from home, etc. So what is the normalized growth rate for the Services business as folks return back to the office in this post-COVID world? And then I have a follow-up.  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  Well, I think you can go back several quarters and try to do a bit of an average, and that's what we were talking about. Of course, there's always a bit of variability around results. Right? But certainly, we haven't done 33% in years. And so that was a bit of an anomaly.  And, again, I explained it's around a couple of the businesses that had a relatively easy compare during the June quarter. So our services growth has been for many, many quarters in strong double digits, and we feel confident around that level.  Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst  Got it. Got it. And then just a follow-up for Tim or Luca. I think, Tim, you mentioned in your prepared comments that in September quarter, there's going to be greater impact on supply constraints on the iPhone and iPad.  So I'm kind of curious, this is the first time I heard you talk about component shortages impacting the iPhone. Can you be more specific? Is it display drivers? Or what exactly is the chokepoint on the supply?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  The majority of constraints we're seeing are of the variety that I think others are seeing that are -- I would classify as industry shortage. We do have some shortages. In addition to that, where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. And so it's a little bit of that as well.  As I said before, I think probably maybe with the basis of your question, the sort of the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been on silicon.  Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst  Thanks, Tim.  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Yes.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?  Operator  Thank you. We'll hear our next question from David Vogt with UBS.  David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst  Great. Thank you, guys, for the question. So maybe just a point of clarification. So based on the data and the comments about upgraders and switchers being strong as well as emerging markets were relatively strong in the quarter, what does that specific set of data point strength mean for the iPhone portfolio? And I guess my question around that is, when you think about switchers and price points, I think last year you launched the SE too to really address maybe some of the lower price point markets like the emerging markets.  So does that mean, thinking about the portfolio going forward, there is less of a need for a lower price product going forward? And that the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high end in nature as we currently have today? And then I have a follow-up.  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Yes, David. We had an incredible quarter for the emerging markets. In Q3, we set June quarter records in Mexico and Brazil and Chile, in Turkey and UAE, in Poland and Czech Republic, India, obviously, in China, as I talked about before, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia. I could go on and name a few more.  It's a very long list. And so we're -- those results are for the entire line of products that we have. And keep in mind, we still do have SE in the line. We launched it a year ago, but it's still in the line today, and it's sort of our entry price point.  And so I'm pleased with how all of them are doing. And I think we need sort of that range of price points to accommodate the types of people that we want to accommodate. And so we've put something for the entry buyer who really wants to get into an iPhone and then something for the pro buyer who wants the very best iPhone that they can buy. And I think that's true in the emerging markets as good as it's true in the United States or other developed markets.  David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst  No. No. That's helpful. I appreciate that, Tim.  So does that mean sort of the emerging market buyer that wants to get into the iPhone is looking for a device that has 5G capability as well? Obviously, we're early innings in a lot of markets. Or how do we think about that over the intermediate to longer term in terms of the consumer preference for 5G in those markets if available from an infrastructure perspective?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  In most of the markets I read, it is really, really, really early on 5G. Really early. And so -- but I think the top-end buyer is buying for the future as well because they may hold their phone for two years or longer in some cases. And so 5G becomes an important part of their buying decision.  David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst  Great. Thank you very much.  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Yes.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research Company.  Ben Bollin -- Cleveland Research Company -- Analyst  Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start, Luca or Tim, could you walk us through a little bit about how you think Apple One bundles are influencing the trajectory of services and the economics? And then a second part on services, I'm curious how you think IDFA is developing and influencing the trajectory of the advertising business within Services.  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  In terms of Apple One, as you know, we're offering Apple One because it makes enjoying our subscription services easier than ever before, including Apple Music and Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade and iCloud and more. And so we really put the customer at the center of that and have recently began to remind people about Apple One in a way that we probably waited a few months before doing that. And so I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on Apple One right now and think it's a great ramp for the future of services. And more importantly, it's a great customer benefit because many of our customers like to try out more than one of these services, and it allows them to do that with one easy bundle and subscription service.  In terms of IDFA or the advertising in general, I take it your question is about ATT. With ATT, we've been getting quite a bit of customer reaction, positive reaction to being able to make the decision on a transparent basis about whether to be tracked or not. And it seems to be going very well from a user point of view.  Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations, and Corporate Finance  Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.  Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst  Yes. Thank you. I have two as well. To begin with, Luca, you noted significant product revenue deleverage, but yet your product gross margins were roughly flat.  You noted cost savings. Can you maybe talk about whether these are tactical in nature or more structural like vertical integration that will continue to drive benefits to product gross margins? And on services side, you noted several times about the strength in ad growth, which is obviously very high-margin contributor, but the sequential trajectory on services margins was flat. So what were some of the offsets there? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.  Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer  Yes. On the product side, I talked about cost savings. Tim mentioned that maybe on the freight side, we're seeing some level of cost pressure that is a bit out of the norm at this point in the cycle. For everything else for all the major commodities and components, we continue to see a very typical cycle where we are getting good cost savings on a sequential basis.  And so far, it's been very good, as you can tell from the absolute level of gross margins because on the product side, we are up more than 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis. So it feels like something that we've been able to accomplish and we're able to maintain, at least in the near term. Nothing that was abnormal during the quarter or a one-off in nature. It was pretty structural.  On the services side, again, up a lot on a year-over-year basis. So the baseline has gone up a lot. The sequential decline, as you said, it was very, very small. And as I mentioned several times in the past, we have a very large services portfolio with very different margin profiles in our services.  And so even a slight change in mix can drive some sequential differences, and this was the case this quarter, just a different mix. I mentioned, for example, that AppleCare has rebounded. And so those -- the relative success of our services in the marketplace can drive some slight changes in gross margins. Again, step back for a second, 69.8% gross margin.  We're very, very, very happy with where we are with the services margin trajectory.  Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst  OK. And, Tim, there is increasing regulatory focus in China, in particular, on some of the Chinese companies. It's not a direct impact of Apple, but how should investors handicap the indirect impact given some of these companies are pretty large contributors to Apple's App Store revenues? And also, is there -- are you seeing any impact at all from these? And is the limiting of the usage of some of these apps influencing how people are either interacting with your devices? Or is there any other ancillary impact that you're seeing?  Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer  Well, for the quarter, as you can see, we grew 58%. So it was a strong quarter, and embedded in that was a quarterly record for Services, which includes the App Store. And so we're seeing strength in China. The economy has really bounced back there fairly quickly from COVID.  In terms of the regulatory focus, what we are focusing on from our angle is to serve users there and to make sure that they're very satisfied with the products and the services that we're showing. And we all -- we work with a lot of different companies to ensure that. And so that's our focus.  Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst  Thanks, Tim.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Druckenmiller’s history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to the 5 Stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is Selling.  Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief of New York-based hedge fund Duquesne Capital, is one of the most renowned names on Wall Street with a personal net worth of over $5.5 billion and a portfolio value of more than $3 billion. Most of his investments are concentrated in the technology and services sector of the economy, with basic materials, finance and healthcare comprising the rest of his holdings. In 2010, when Druckenmiller announced he would be closing Duquesne Capital to new investors, he had never had a losing year in three decades.  Despite not accepting new investors, the billionaire still issues regulatory filings publicly. According to these filings, some of the top holdings in the Duquesne Capital portfolio at the end of the first quarter of 2021 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), among others. Together, these represent close to 20% of the entire investment portfolio of Duquesne Capital, with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) occupying the top position.  Druckenmiller became famous after he helped George Soros, the chief of Soros Fund Management, short the British pound in 1992, making the hedge fund more than $1 billion in the process. While working closely with Soros for most of his finance career, Druckenmiller developed expertise in currencies and interest rates. This has helped him achieve success with Duquesne Capital. During the financial crisis of 2009, his fund was one of the few that posted positive returns, although it failed to match the record returns posted in the preceding years.  Druckenmiller, along with Soros, has over the years perfected the art of macro trading. This involves blending two types of investment strategies into one. One is betting on global currencies, keeping in mind political trends, and the other is conventional stock trading through research on basic business fundamentals. The success of Druckenmiller is an exception in the industry that is reeling from the rise of fintech and a dramatic shift in market dynamics spurred by retail traders that actively spoil hedge fund bets.  Story continues  The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Stan Druckenmiller Duquesne  Stan Druckenmiller  With this context in mind, here is our list of the 10 stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling. These were ranked keeping in mind the investment portfolio of Duquesne Capital at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Druckenmiller's fund sold off their entire stakes in these companies during the first three months of the year.  Stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is Selling  10. Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES)  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26  Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) is placed tenth on our list of 10 stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling. The stock has returned 85% to investors in the past year. The company explores, develops, and produces oil, gas, and other fossil fuels. Duquesne Capital has sold-off stake in the firm over the past few months and at the end of March, did not own any shares in the company.  Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) on June 11 declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with previous.  Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) with 3.3 million shares worth more than $235 million.  Unlike Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) is one of the stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling.  In its Q2 2020 investor letter, Massif Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:  “We took a short position in Hess (HES) during the first quarter due to what we believed to be a weakness in their assertion that the Bakken would serve as a cash engine, along with their Gulf of Mexico assets, to pay for the development of their offshore Guyana fields. Our analysis suggested that not only was their fracking in the Bakken unprofitable but that it was unlikely ever to be so. The market very quickly told us that although we might be right in our analysis of the fundamentals, it did not care. We suspect that much of this has to do with the fact that Hess had hedged nearly 100% of their production in 2020 during the relatively high priced 2019 period, but we cannot be certain. Since we closed out the position, the stock has rallied a further 45%. We take this as directional evidence (perhaps) of a good decision. Hess contributed -0.19% to the portfolio during the quarter. We have mostly avoided shorting oil companies in the last few years. The opportunity is appealing but extremely tricky to evaluate. Hess remains an interesting short. We have little confidence in the long-term viability of operations in the Bakken, and Hess remains a large player. Yet as the firm moves further along in their development and monetization of assets in Guyana, the weight of the Bakkens failure to play a meaningful role in producing positive free cash flow becomes increasingly difficult to determine by looking at the financials and perhaps less significant to the market. One thing that seems increasingly true of the environment we are investing in is that bad capital allocation by management teams can be easily forgiven if there is plenty of liquidity, even if access to liquid capital imperils long-term solvency.”  9. Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: LYV)  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37  Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: LYV) is an entertainment company that promotes and sells tickets for different live events worldwide. It is ranked ninth on our list of 10 stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling. The company’s shares have returned 83% to investors in the past twelve months. Druckenmiller has sold off the entire Duquesne stake in the firm over the past few months.  On May 14, investment advisory Wolfe initiated coverage on Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: LYV) stock with an Outperform rating and a year-end price target of $97, implying 13% upside potential for the stock that is soaring as the economy reopens and public events resume.  Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Virginia-based investment firm Akre Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: LYV) with 5.4 million shares worth more than $462 million.  Unlike Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: LYV) is one of the stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling.  In its Q4 2020 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: LYV) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:  “In 2006, we initiated our position in Live Nation, the global entertainment company that handles promotion, venue management and ticket sales for live events. Live Nation was spun out of the former Clear Channel Communications in late 2005. In our view, spinoffs often represent attractive opportunities because investors frequently undervalue the new company. We believed this was the case with Live Nation, especially given its initially small market capitalization. As well, when spinoffs are freed from their parents, they typically benefit from intensified management focus and more flexible capital allocation policies. In Live Nation’s case, the spinoff helped make possible the merger with Ticketmaster in 2010, which materially improved the business franchise. Although these factors alone might have made Live Nation a good holding for the Fund, an unexpected technology helped to boost the company’s fortunes: streaming. As the advantages of streaming convinced consumers to reduce or even eliminate their purchases of media, such as CDs and DVDs, artists began to tour more, thereby providing a tailwind to Live Nation’s operations. This accelerated growth in the company’s intrinsic value per share, which in turn generated numerous increases in our sell target for the holding, enabling us to continue to own the shares in the Fund for 14 years. We typically target a three- to five-year holding period for our equity investments, but we love opportunities like Live Nation, which achieve unanticipated intrinsic value growth.”  8. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN)  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43  BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) stock has returned 8% to investors over the past three months. It is a biotechnology company that develops therapies for rare diseases. It is placed eighth on our list of 10 stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling. Duquesne Capital no longer holds any stake in the firm, according to the latest filings.  On April 29, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) posted earnings for the first quarter of 2021, reporting earnings per share of $0.09, beating market predictions by $0.19. The revenue over the period was $486 million, down 3% year-on-year.

Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE: CCL)  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44  Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE: CCL) is ranked seventh on our list of 10 stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling.

(NASDAQ: PYPL), Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE: CCL) is one of the stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling.  In its Q1 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE: CCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:  “Several of our better performers in the first quarter were purchased while their business models were under stress from COVID restrictions or the macro environment the pandemic created. What gave us confidence in purchasing Carnival was the actions the company took to extend out their balance sheets until travel resumed. Both should benefit as a broader vaccination rollout prompts cruise lines to resume operations and consumers to start traveling again and are positioned to deliver better margins and gain pricing power as the economy normalizes due to the cost controls implemented during the downturn.”  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50  Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI) is a company that makes and sells integrated circuits, software, and subsystems. It is placed sixth on our list of 10 stocks Stanley Druckenmiller is selling.

Investors can buy Amazon stock in Canadian dollars  The NEO Exchange introduced one new and very interesting ticker on Tuesday morning. That ticker is labeled AMZN (Amazon.com CDR (CAD Hedged)). Over 8,000 units had changed hands by midday with settlement within the $22.80-$23.28 price range.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) has introduced more trading convenience to Canadian investors through a currency-hedged Canadian Depository Receipt (CDR) series on Amazon.com common shares.  Canadian Depository Receipts are certificates issued by domestic banks representing shares in foreign-listed companies. The CDR affords investors the opportunity to hold shares in the equity of foreign companies and to trade such shares on local exchanges.  Amazon hasn’t directly listed its common stock in Canada yet, but local investors have the opportunity to buy AMZN stock in Canadian dollars thanks to the NEO Exchange and CIBC’s latest innovation.  Local investors who are concerned about associated foreign currency risks, and those who don’t like incurring foreign currency conversion costs when buying the U.S-listed company’s shares now have a local alternative.  Most noteworthy, the new CDRs allow for fractional share ownership on AMZN. You don’t have to raise over $4,600 to buy just one share in Jeff Bezos’s online retail business anymore. Just $25 can get you into the game, and you can participate in Amazon’s future growth story with a much lower cash outlay.  An e-commerce giant: A growth investor’s dream  The internet giant has generated over 1,590% in capital gains over the past 10 years. An amount of US$10,000 invested in Amazon stock 10 years ago could have grown into US$169,000 today.  Story continues  AMZN Stock Chart  Buy-and-hold investors in Amazon.com stock have made fortunes over the past decade. Source: YCharts  Long-term-focused, buy-and-hold investors who worry about exchange rate risks could like this detail. CIBC edges AMZN CDRs against exchange rate risks. Currency risks arise due to unpredictable fluctuations between the USD and the CAD exchange rate.  That said, currency exposures add a layer of returns when the exchange rate moves in one’s favour. A Canadian needed under $0.95 to buy US$1 in mid-2011. And they needed under $9,500 to buy US$10,000 worth of Amazon stock. Fast forward to July 2021, that US$10,000 investment is worth over $212,900, thanks to foreign currency gains.  If the Canadian dollar were to weaken against the United States dollar over the next 10 years, investors who buy Amazon stock CDRs in Canada today will miss an added layer of returns from foreign exchange exposure.  Foolish bottom line  The NEO Exchange has brought a welcome innovation to the Canadian stock market. CIBC’s introduction of a foreign currency-hedged CDR on a much-loved U.S.-listed global e-commerce giant brings trading convenience and added investment options to Canadian retail investors. Fellow Fools will like that.  If you wished to avoid currency risks while buying Amazon stock, you have added convenience today. That said, currency exposure could add a layer of potential returns in the long term.

Here\'s how the company did:  Earnings: $15.12 vs $12.30 per share, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv  $15.12 vs $12.30 per share, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv Revenue: $113.08 billion vs $115.2 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv  Amazon\'s revenue grew by 27% year over year to $113.08 billion. That\'s a significant slowdown from the second quarter of 2020, when sales skyrocketed 41% year over year.  On a call with reporters, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky blamed tough year-over-year comparisons to its business during Covid-19 lockdowns. In mid-May of last year, Amazon saw growth rates jump to between 35% to 45%, he said.  ""We\'re starting to lap that and that\'s why you see some of the growth rate coming down,"" Olsavsky said, adding that Amazon expects to see slower growth continue for the next few quarters.  For the third quarter, Amazon said it expects to book sales between $106 billion and $112 billion, representing growth of 10% to 16% compared to the same period last year. That\'s well below consensus estimates of $119.2 billion.  ""Our customers are safe and healthy and ordering from us. And we know that there\'ll be more vacations or be more mobility. They\'ll be things that probably people shied away from last year and that\'s all good,"" Olsavsky said on the call with reporters. ""But it does tend to lead them to do other things besides shop. So we\'re just adjusting our run rates in the, in the period that we see that happening.""  The guidance echoes similar warnings from Facebook and Apple , who said in quarterly earnings earlier this week that revenue growth rates would decelerate from pandemic highs.  Amazon said its operating profit in the third quarter will be in the range of $2.5 billion and $6 billion, a notably wide gap. That\'s still a step down from the $6.2 billion of costs it incurred from things like coronavirus safety measures in the third quarter of 2020.  Olsavsky said in a call with investors that Amazon is in the midst of a multiyear investment cycle, which includes spending heavily to increase warehouse capacity across the country. Most of Amazon\'s 2021 spend and building openings are planned for the second-half of the year, he added.  The June quarter reflects the last full quarter of Jeff Bezos\' tenure as CEO. On July 5, Bezos handed the role of CEO over to Andy Jassy, who previously led AWS. Bezos is now executive chairman. Like Bezos, who hasn\'t participated in an earnings call since 2009, Jassy was absent from Thursday evening\'s conference call.  In a statement, Jassy thanked Amazon employees for their work during the coronavirus pandemic, and added, ""I am very excited to work with you as we invent and build for the future.""  While Amazon\'s second-quarter sales disappointed, earnings trounced expectations, helped by its highly profitable cloud-computing, subscriptions and advertising businesses. Amazon\'s ""other"" unit, which includes advertising and other services, grew revenue 87% year over year during the period.  Amazon Web Services grew its revenue 37% in the second quarter, faster than 32% growth in the previous quarter. AWS revenue came in at $14.81 billion in the quarter, surpassing analysts\' estimated $14.20 billion.  Amazon\'s headcount continues to swell. At the end of the third quarter, Amazon employed 1.33 million people worldwide, up 52% year over year.  A rise in the Covid-19 delta variant cases has pushed some Silicon Valley companies, including Facebook , Google , Uber and Twitter , to rethink their return-to-office plans and mandate vaccinations for employees or close offices again. Olsavsky told reporters that Amazon hasn\'t adjusted its plans to have employees return in September. The company will not require employees to be vaccinated, he said.  WATCH: Amazon stock is on the verge of a comeback, Jim Cramer says']","['There’s certainly plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is overextended right now. Traditional valuation metrics are just about as high as they’ve ever been for the chip giant. Its price-earnings ratio sits above 90 currently, worse than roughly 83% of industry peers.  Nvidia (NVDA) stock logo on a smartphone.  Source: Allmy / Shutterstock.com  But guess what? It doesn’t matter long term because there’s many more reasons to believe it’ll rise. There may be a temporary cooling period, but company prospects are as bright as ever.  I’d say that NVDA stock has every right to have moved as high as it has over the past five weeks.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  Q1 Results Speak Volumes  There was very little bad that could possibly be said about Nvidia’s Q1 results. Revenue was up massively from a year earlier, and 13% on the quarter. Net income more than doubled over the past year, and 31% on the quarter. The overall business and financial picture were stellar.  And on a business-by-business basis things were equally positive. Gaming revenues were more than double where they were a year earlier. And each of Nvidia’s data center, professional visualization and automotive businesses also realized revenue growth as well.  Just about the only arguable dull spot was that cash flows from operations declined 9% from the previous quarter. Even that could be explained away in that the company made a $317 million investment in capital expenditures.  On those results NVDA stock has been tearing upwards from $546 in mid-May to hitting $800 this week. The price chart indicates that shares might run sideways for a bit, but most believe it’ll continue upward.  If most believe it’ll continue to rise, what then might cause it trouble?  Valuation and Gaming Concerns  One of the major concerns about Nvidia moving out of the pandemic is that its gaming revenues may falter. The bearish thesis is that as the pandemic wanes so too will gaming pulling Nvidia down in the process.  Story continues  Gaming did contribute $2.76 billion to Nvidia’s $5.66 billion of revenues in Q1. But that argument relies on the idea that gaming only became popular because we were cooped up due to the pandemic. It’s just as easy to believe the trend is here to stay and that the pandemic simply added fuel to the trend.  Then there’s the idea that Nvidia should drop because it’s overpriced.  Nothing New  That Nvidia is technically overvalued is likely news to no one. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, it carries a very high P/E ratio. The company’s other valuation metrics are equally skewed. Nvidia’s price-book and price-sales ratios are both among the lowest 5% in the semiconductor industry.  But these concerns are nothing new and the fact remains that Nvidia has been on a long upward trend since the end of 2018. Those who have bet against it over the last two-and-a-half years have lost.  Investors will continue to be willing to pay richly for a dollar of its earnings and many multiples of its book value as long as it remains hot. Many believe Nvidia is going to stay up.  There’s one simple way to gauge whether investors believe Nvidia’s prices will go down. It’s one we often associate with low-priced, volatile meme stocks rather than NVDA. That’s short interest.  Short interest volume for Nvidia is down over the last month by 6.29%. So those investors clearly abandoned the idea that shares would go down.  Takeaway  Clearly Wall Street believes that will be exactly what happens. In the last few days analysts from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Tigress Financial, and Raymond James (NYSE:RJF) raised their price targets to between $875 and $920.  There are far more people believing in NVDA than not. The same old narratives follow it but those who invest in those will be fighting against a greater tide.

More From InvestorPlace  The post Nvidia Stock Will Continue to Buck Bearish Narratives appeared first on InvestorPlace.', 'Nvidia (NVDA 16.19%) is one of the world\'s most talked-about chipmakers. It\'s the market leader in gaming GPUs, its top-tier GPUs process AI tasks for data centers and driverless cars, and its Arm-based CPUs power gaming consoles, set-top boxes, and servers.  However, Nvidia has seemed to dominate headlines more frequently than many other chipmakers over the past year. Let\'s delve into the five main reasons everyone has been talking about Nvidia.  1. Its proposed purchase of Arm Holdings  Nvidia agreed to buy Arm Holdings, one of the world\'s largest chip designers, for $40 billion from SoftBank last September. Arm doesn\'t manufacture any chips, but it licenses its designs to chipmakers like Qualcomm and Apple. Arm-based chips now power over 95% of the world\'s smartphones.  If Nvidia buys Arm, it will support the development of its current Arm-based CPUs (including Tegra and the data center-oriented Grace) and new CPUs. But this acquisition won\'t close anytime soon, due to antitrust probes, opposition from rival chipmakers, and a lengthy legal battle against Arm China\'s CEO Allen Wu -- who is refusing to resign even after being ousted.  New developments in this messy takeover attempt could keep Nvidia in the headlines -- and raise questions about its long-term goals.  2. The global chip shortage  Nvidia is a fabless chipmaker that outsources the production of its chips to Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.20%). Therefore, the global chip shortage -- which started before the pandemic but was exacerbated by the crisis -- will impact its ability to meet the market\'s demand for new chips.  During last quarter\'s conference call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress warned that it would ""remain supply constrained into the second half of the year."" Analysts still expect Nvidia\'s revenue to jump 49% this year, thanks to robust demand for its gaming and data center GPUs, but its growth rates would likely be even higher if it weren\'t facing a global chip shortage.  3. Another brewing cryptocurrency crisis  When cryptocurrency prices surged in 2017, many miners hoarded Nvidia\'s gaming GPUs, which resulted in a market shortage and high prices for PC gamers. But when crypto prices plunged in 2018, those miners sold their used GPU cards at lower prices, which flooded the market with excess inventories and curbed demand for Nvidia\'s newer GPUs.  Earlier this year, Nvidia took proactive steps to avoid another bubble by halving the hash rate, or mining efficiency, for Ethereum (ETH 2.25%) in its new RTX gaming GPUs. It also announced it would launch dedicated CMP (cryptocurrency mining processor) products for miners.  Unfortunately, miners quickly circumvented Nvidia\'s anti-mining measures, hoarded the chips again, and subsequently dumped them amid China\'s cryptocurrency crackdown and an upcoming tweak to Ethereum -- which will make it impossible for traditional GPUs to mine the cryptocurrency for a profit. These events could all cause familiar headaches for Nvidia again later this year.  4. The rumors about Intel and GlobalFoundries  Nvidia\'s stock recently dipped after The Wall Street Journal claimed Intel (INTC -0.94%) was interested in buying Advanced Micro Devices\'s former foundry partner, GlobalFoundries, for $30 billion. Intel already plans to double down on its first-party foundries to catch up to TSMC and Samsung, so buying GlobalFoundries could complement those plans.  That expansion could also support the production of Intel\'s new line of discrete GPUs, which launched in late 2020. These GPUs haven\'t gained any significant market share against Nvidia and AMD yet, but they might eventually gain a foothold with aggressive pricing and bundling strategies.  But that\'s all speculation for now, and Intel still faces a long uphill battle in the gaming GPU market -- so the sell-off was merely a knee-jerk reaction to some market noise.  5. Nvidia\'s stock split  Lastly, Nvidia\'s scheduled 4-for-1 stock split on July 20 has attracted attention from investors who previously thought its shares looked too expensive. But stock splits don\'t actually change a stock\'s real valuation, which is traditionally gauged by its price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios since investors still own the same percentage of the company. So if you think Nvidia is too expensive at 40 times forward earnings, then a stock split shouldn\'t change your mind.  In theory, splitting Nvidia\'s stock could attract some smaller retail investors who don\'t want to pay $700 for a single share. But most trading platforms, including Robinhood, already offer free fractional trades -- so investors shouldn\'t expect Nvidia\'s stock split to attract a stampede of bulls.  The key takeaways  Out of these five points, investors should pay more attention to the Arm deal, the ongoing chip shortage, and the potential crypto bubble instead of Intel\'s foundry plans or the 4-for-1 stock split. The first three points could impact Nvidia\'s growth, while the last two points are mainly market noise.']","[""Search engine behemoth Alphabet (GOOG) has grown into a formidable tech superstar in the matter of a couple of decades. Since the company’s IPO in 2004, shares of GOOG stock have been a 50-bagger for patient investors. Indeed, that kind of growth is hard to come by with any stock over such a long time frame. Accordingly, an easy case can be made for long-term investors to continue holding this growth gem in their core portfolios in the decades to come.  As a tech giant, Alphabet’s core search business has become large enough to warrant regulatory scrutiny. We’ll get to some of the ramifications of this in a minute. However, investors who remain keen on Alphabet continue to believe that bigger is better in the monopolistic search engine space.  Google’s growth segments, such as the company’s cloud division, are where investors have been placing increasing emphasis lately. Indeed, other than Chinese tech giants Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY), and Baidu (BIDU), Google is among the fastest-growing cloud players globally, and catching up to U.S. rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Let’s dive into whether this segment will be enough to take Alphabet over the psychologically-important $2 trillion market cap level soon. (See Alphabet stock charts)  Google's Cloud Growth Impressive, But Coming at a Cost  Alphabet has grown its cloud business to an impressive size. According to the company’s recent financial statements, Alphabet’s cloud division grew 46% year-over-year in the company’s latest quarter. Cloud revenues of $4 billion were substantial, but made up only 7.3% of the company’s overall revenue for the quarter.  Indeed, Alphabet’s Google search engine business is still the economic engine of the company. Google (net YouTube) generated 82% of Alphabet’s overall revenue. Accordingly, this is still by and large the business segment that matters, particularly from an earnings standpoint.  Google’s cloud business is growing in importance for Alphabet, but remains highly unprofitable. The company lost $974 million in earning its $4 billion in revenue this past quarter. The reality is, Alphabet is still buying market share in the cloud space. Until the company is able to scale up this business to a level where it can compete on quality rather than price, this is likely to be the case.  Story continues  However, like many of Alphabet’s unprofitable businesses, such as those included in Alphabet’s “Other Bets” category (which lost even more money), investors remain bullish on Alphabet’s ability to monetize these businesses well, as it has done with YouTube. Time will ultimately tell how profitable Google’s rising prevalence in cloud computing will be. All in all, should margins begin to expand significantly in this segment, investors can expect to see significant gains over time.  Is Alphabet’s Size Becoming a Problem?  Bigger is usually better in the corporate world. Economies of scale and margin improvements over time, combined with a durable competitive advantage (moat) is what every company is after. In many respects, Alphabet’s Google segment enjoys these benefits right now.  However, regulatory concerns are starting to rear their ugly head with this company. In the U.S., Alphabet has become one of the punching bags for regulators in recent years. The U.K. is probing Google and Amazon over fake reviews. Additionally, investors may recall that pesky ruling in France where Alphabet was slapped with a 220 million euro fine for abusing its market power.  Anti-monopolistic crackdowns are happening all around the world as governments look to rein in big tech. China’s incredible crackdown on its own tech leaders has shown how painful such a targeted crackdown can be.  For investors in Alphabet, these concerns are likely easy to ignore. On the one hand, regulatory risks are certainly worth pricing in. After all, the government calls the shots with respect to how large it allows companies to get.  On the other hand, the U.S. and most free-market countries have proven to defer to technological innovation in most cases. Additionally, fines of a few hundred million dollars are really nothing to a company like Alphabet, which generates tens of billions of operating income every year.  For now, these are risks investors should be watching and keep an eye on. However, the camp that remains firm in its stance that regulatory concerns are either immaterial or non-existent seems to be correct, at least thus far.  What Analysts are Saying about GOOG Stock  According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, GOOG stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 10 analyst ratings, there are 10 Buy recommendations.  As for price targets, the average GOOG price target is $2,741.67. Analyst price targets range from a low of $2,510.00 per share to a high of $2,900.00 per share.  Google stock forecast  Bottom Line on GOOG  Alphabet remains a world-class tech company with tremendous growth potential over the long-run. That said, valuations are getting stretched today in the mega-cap tech space, so investors may want to be cautious when considering adding to their positions.  Regardless, those holding onto shares of GOOG stock really don’t have any reason to sell. Getting any sort of reasonable return in this market requires taking on some level of risk. Indeed, today, Alphabet appears to be one of the lower-risk bets in the high tech space today.

Meanwhile, one Wall Street trader is pointing to its recent ""glass bottom"" chart formation as a sign that Tesla bulls are starting to show signs of life.  Recently, on Yahoo Finance Live, Michele Schneider, partner and director of trading research and education at Marketgauge.com, broke down the particulars of this classically bullish pattern. She said that in May, Tesla stock fell below $600 per share, probing the $550 level, which had been its prior support in March.  Importantly, this was the lowest price level in 60 days, but price action quickly confirmed investor participation. The day after shares hit a price low, Tesla managed to close above the high of that reversal day, signaling a potential bottom when combined with the fresh 60-day low.  Tesla\'s ""glass bottom"".  ""That was really an amazing opportunity to get into Tesla because at that point you had about a $30 risk — which for a stock trading with that type of volatility is really good. It\'s like having a $2 risk for [a stock] like Apple (AAPL),"" said Schneider.  After the bounce, Tesla rallied to the key $700 price level where it pulled back and began consolidating. Schneider said that a break through that level puts the possibility of the stock potentially reaching $800, adding that investors shouldn\'t pay too much attention to the company\'s earnings.  ""Tesla is more of a momentum stock than an actual stock based on its real valuation. So you can forget about all the fundamentals and really, in this case I think, watch those technicals for that set-up,"" she said.  Click here for free registration to all.

In the year-ago quarter, net income amounted to $104 million. Overall automotive revenue came in at $10.21 billion, of which only $354 million, about 3.5%, came from sales of regulatory credits. That\'s a lower number for credits than in any of the previous four quarters. Automotive gross margins were 28.4%, higher than in any of the last four quarters. Tesla had already reported deliveries (its closest approximation to sales) of 201,250 electric vehicles, and production of 206,421 total vehicles, during the quarter ended June 30, 2021.  The company also reported $801 million in revenue from its energy business, including solar photovoltaics and energy storage systems for homes, businesses and utilities, an increase of more than 60% from last quarter. While Tesla does not disclose how many energy storage units it sells each quarter, in recent weeks CEO Elon Musk said, in court, that the company would only be able to produce 30,000 to 35,000 at best during the current quarter, blaming the lag on chip shortages. Tesla also reported $951 million in services and other revenues. The company now operates 598 stores and service centers, and a mobile service fleet including 1,091 vehicles, an increase of just 34% versus a year ago. That compares with an increase of 121% in vehicle deliveries year over year. A $23 million impairment related to the value of its bitcoin holdings was reported as an operating expense under ""Restructuring and other."" The company\'s cash position decreased about 5% from last quarter, to $16.23 billion. The decline was ""driven mainly by net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.6B, partially offset by free cash flow of $619M,"" the company said in its earnings statement. Accounts payable — the amount of money Tesla owes suppliers and other service providers — rose by 13.7% from the previous quarter to $7.56 billion.  During the quarter, among other challenges, Tesla faced a backlash from consumers in China, recalls in China and the U.S., and delayed deliveries of the high-performance version of its flagship sedan, the Model S Plaid. Institutional and retail investors asked for updates on when the company plans to start commercial production of its Cybertruck and custom battery cells, and how Tesla will weather ongoing parts shortages and the rising cost of raw materials that Musk previously complained about. Parts shortages have been stubbornly persistent for Tesla and other automakers. In its shareholder deck, Tesla said that it had delayed the launch of the Semi truck program until 2022. On the shareholder call Monday, Musk said a ""big struggle this quarter"" was to procure enough modules that control the airbags and seatbelts in Tesla vehicles. The lack of supply limited the company\'s production both in Fremont, California, and Shanghai. Musk also said that many fans ask why Tesla doesn\'t just make its own chips to avoid shortages. He said that supply chain issues are something Tesla will solve with suppliers, laughing that ""It\'s not like you can just whip up a chip fab."" Because Tesla uses a lot of the same semiconductors and battery cells in cars as it does in energy storage products, Musk said, the company has reduced its production of Powerwalls, and its Megapack battery systems for use at power stations are sold out until the end of next year. Musk said he believes there is probably demand for ""in excess of a million Powerwalls per year,"" and an unspecified but vast amount of Megapacks for utilities given the push to transition to renewable energy. ""Solar and wind are intermittent and by their nature really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity,"" he explained. As a strategy to manage its supply chain issues for both cars and energy storage products, Musk said Tesla would ""overshoot"" on cell supply for vehicles and whenever there is excess, it could route that supply over to making Powerwalls and Megapacks.']","['Investors should take advantage of Airbnb \'s relatively cheap stock price to buy into a future winner in the travel industry, according to investment firm BTIG.

It's no secret that the movie theater industry was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. However, box office sales are once again increasing as economies around the world gradually reopen.  1. IMAX  IMAX (IMAX -0.85%) is known for its proprietary screen technology that it licenses to exhibitors, including AMC. The company has an asset-light business model, and it doesn't have to build or maintain theaters. IMAX licenses include the intellectual property and tech that allow massive screens to show films.  Another competitive advantage is that the company's premium screens allow exhibitors to charge higher ticket prices to the many moviegoers willing to pay more for immersive experiences. This characteristic could become increasingly valuable as movie theater chains contend with and adapt to competition from streaming services. Top Gun: Maverick 's generation of more than $1 billion in ticket sales indicates people are still hungry for theatrical experiences. 2022 releases, including Avatar: The Way of Water, could once again highlight the value of IMAX's technologies and services.  With the theater business increasingly revolving around big-budget, special-effects-heavy films that benefit from IMAX's premium viewing format, the company is on track to play a big role in shaping the future of the industry. IMAX is also financially strong -- taking into consideration the effects of the pandemic -- and has more cash than debt on its balance sheet.  2. The Walt Disney Company  The Walt Disney Company (DIS -0.13%) is not a pure-play movie theater stock, but few companies are better positioned to benefit if the theater industry experiences a strong recovery. Before the pandemic, Disney was dominating the box office, and the House of Mouse will undoubtedly continue to shape the future of cinema.  The company released seven films in 2019 that grossed more than $1 billion at the global box office, and its movies recorded more than $13 billion in total ticket sales. Getting back to that high mark will be a challenge, but Disney is well positioned to continue dominating the movie business.  With its wealth of popular characters and mega-franchises, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars , the company's stable of content is unmatched. Disney's 2021 theatrical release Spider-Man: No Way Home grossed more than $1.9 billion in global ticket sales and stands as the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time, which suggests the box office is bouncing back in a big way and Disney is still top dog.  The diversified nature of Disney's businesses also makes the company a less-risky investment than pure-play movie theater stocks. If the theatrical segment falters, the company's popular Disney+ streaming service should still enable it to benefit from ongoing growth in demand for streaming media. Disney's parks and resorts and media networks also typically perform well, in part because the media empire has numerous lucrative channels for monetizing its characters and content.  One stock to avoid: AMC Entertainment  AMC Entertainment (AMC -4.05%) is the world's largest movie theater chain. In a surprising turn of events, the stock has also posted impressive returns over the past few years despite a challenging industry backdrop and weak business performance.  AMC's share price skyrocketed in early 2021, thanks to a short squeeze and the stock's becoming a favorite among retail investors on Reddit and other social media hubs. Shares have come down substantially from the high amid the meme-stock fervor, but business challenges and valuation concerns remain.  With more than $5.5 billion in long-term debt, repaying that and a sizable interest expense will be a challenge even if the movie theater chain sells more stock. The company lost $4.6 billion in 2020 and roughly $1.27 billion in 2021 -- understandable in pandemic conditions -- but it was unprofitable in 2019, too.  AMC's status as a meme stock means its trading price is likely still divorced from the company's business fundamentals. The movie theater industry should continue to recover this year, but AMC stock is probably too volatile for most investors."", 'Why did this happen?

Spending on medical services at the company\'s health insurance business, UnitedHealthcare, rebounded in the latter part of last year due to Covid-19 testing and treatment-related customer assistance measures, after patients and hospitals had delayed care at the height of the pandemic.

The company has two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare, and has four reportable business segments including OptumHealth, OptumInsight, OptumRx, and UnitedHealthcare.  The company reported better-than-expected financial results in Q2 and posted revenues of $71.3 billion, up 14.8% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS came in at $4.70 versus $7.12 in the same quarter a year back.  UNH raised its outlook for FY21 based on its fiscal performance in the first half of the year and now expects adjusted EPS to come in at $18.30 to $18.80 per share. UNH stated in its press release, “The outlook continues to include approximately $1.80 per share in potential net unfavorable COVID-19 effects.”  Following the Q2 results, Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $440 to $465 on the stock.  Wiederhorn noted that UNH’s management said that the treatment or testing costs for COVID-19 were highest in April, but decreased after that. UNH’s CFO John Rex noted at the company’s Q2 earnings call that while utilization of healthcare services among commercial patients was slightly above baseline, utilization among Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries was still not at their usual rates, so costs remained below the baseline.  UNH’s UnitedHealthcare offers a complete spectrum of health benefit programs. This includes offering consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services to commercial customers, including public sector and mid-sized employers. This segment also serves Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. (See UnitedHealth stock chart on TipRanks)  Story continues  The company serves Medicaid beneficiaries in exchange “for a monthly premium per member from the state program.” To determine payments for treating Medicare patients, the Medicare risk adjustment (MRA) model assigns a risk score to each Medicare beneficiary based on certain parameters, and this risk score is used to calculate a risk-adjusted base payment amount. This amount is then used to calculate total reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries.  When it comes to Medicare risk adjustment (MRA) revenues, Wiederhorn is of the view that these will rebound next year. The reason for the analyst’s optimism is that UNH noted that the mid-year risk-adjustment payment for this year “was in line with expectations."" Additionally, he liked UnitedHealth\'s statement that its physicians are well engaged with their patients, indicated by the fact that the number of house calls provided by its clinicians nearly doubled from the first half of last year to 1.1 million visits in 1H21.  In conclusion, Wiederhorn said, “We believe the company is positioned well for growth in 2022. Management acknowledges that the trajectory of COVID-19 is unpredictable, but the $1.80/share impact is largely expected to go away next year. This would seem to suggest 2022 growth could exceed its normal 13–16% longterm target by a healthy portion of that $1.80 impact (~9%).”  Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 16 Buys and 2 Holds. The average UnitedHealth price target of $461.29 implies approximately 10.1% upside potential to current levels.  Humana (HUM)  Humana has three business segments including Retail, Group and Specialty, and Healthcare services. Most of its products or plans under the three business segments are centered around the Medicare program.  Humana is expected to release its Q2 results on July 28.  In Q1, HUM reported adjusted revenues of $20.75 billion, up by around 10% year-over-year from $18.9 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings came in at $7.67 per share versus $5.40 per share.  Following the Q1 earnings, Humana updated its EPS outlook for FY21 and anticipates it to range between $19.62 to $20.12 per share on a GAAP basis. HUM expects EPS to come in between $21.25 to $21.75 per share on an adjusted basis.  Last month, Humana held its Investor Day. Following the Investor Day presentation, Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn reiterated a Buy and a price target of $480 on the stock.  Humana stated at its Investor Day that it expects to have exposure of $56,000 per year to the cost of Aduhelm, Biogen’s (BIIB) Alzheimer’s drug that was recently approved. The company added that it will bear these costs ""at least until they can adjust bids in 2023.”  Wiederhorn commented, “However, management expects a slow up-take as not all patients are appropriate, and the medical hurdles take time. Additionally, the government could share part/all of the burden. Humana believes its Alzheimer\'s exposure is similar to Medicare (~10% of beneficiaries).”  Additionally, Humana is a provider of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, and its pharmacy solutions manage prescription drug coverage for individuals and employer groups. The company stated at its Investor Day that while it expects a mid-year MRA payment update on July 1, HUM management expects volatility from this release. That\'s because 25% of Medicare members “are in their first full-year with HUM” as a result of the pandemic. (See Humana stock chart on TipRanks)  In other news, last week, Humana agreed to acquire One Homecare Solutions (onehome) from its private equity owner WayPoint Capital Partners for an undisclosed amount. The company expects to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of this year.  Onehome provides home-based health services, pioneering a value-based model in Texas and Florida. It is also a care and risk manager. It offers infusion care, nursing, and durable medical equipment services.  According to Wiederhorn, HUM stated at its Investor Day that “20–35% of total MA spend is addressable in the home and believes its portfolio can address the entire continuum.”  Summing up, the analyst said, “We believe that Humana boasts a compelling growth opportunity in the increasingly appealing MA market. Furthermore, the company also has an opportunity to drive margins given a potentially more favorable reimbursement environment and the maturation of its high-growth member base. Given the attractive growth of the company\'s MA business, we believe Humana should return significant returns to shareholders.”  Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 5 Holds. The average Humana price target of $490.54 implies approximately 5.2% upside potential to current levels.  Bottom Line  While analysts are cautiously optimistic about Humana, they are bullish about UnitedHealth Group. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, UNH does seem to be a better Buy.  Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Strong Buy Stocks to Invest In.  Uncertainty has been clouding over the stock market in the United States as investors exercise caution in the wake of a dramatic rise in the prices of commodities and a Chinese government crackdown against dual-listed firms. In June, the Labor Department reported that inflation had surged at the fastest pace seen in thirteen years with the Consumer Price Index, an index that measures changes in the price level of consumer goods and services, registering a 5.4% increase year-to-year, largely due to an increase in prices of cars, food, and energy.  In tandem with these inflation fears, Chinese stocks in the US have registered a dramatic drop in prices, evidenced by the recent freefall in the price of ride-hailing service DiDi after a blockbuster IPO. Beijing is also tightening control over crypto-related companies in the country, hitting crypto stocks that had been on a record bull run till a few months ago, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of around $64,000 in April. Amid all these uncertainties, it has become difficult to identify strong buys that are sure to offer investors handsome returns.  Investment advisory Raymond James, headquartered in Florida, has identified some Strong Buy stocks which include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE: UNH), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP), and Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD), among others. These are discussed in detail below. The stocks offer a mix of growth and value offerings. As consumers continue to beat the brunt of an increase in the prices of commodities, a Bank of America survey has revealed that professional investors believe inflation is only temporary.  The complexity of the interdependent world economy has made it exceedingly difficult to keep up with the market dynamics. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and May 29th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 206.8%, vs. 91.0% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 115 percentage points (see the details here).

Although other travelrelated companies were facing dire circumstances, Allegiant wasn’t forced to raise dilutive equity or take government money. Since then, Allegiant has strengthened its relationships with pilots and crews and has positioned itself to benefit from leisure travel—which should accelerate sooner than business travel.”  9.

Here is what the fund said:  “Despite initiating a position in the fourth quarter, Alaska Airlines Group, Inc (ALK) was sold during the first quarter. The Alaska Airlines investment was envisioned to be a long-term investment, but the stock price appreciated more quickly than expected. Like many other “re-open trades”, the value of the company including its debt now exceeds the value pre-pandemic. For that to be reasonable I’d have to believe: 1) The company/industry had too little debt and by adding debt they’ve better optimized their balance sheet for equity returns while still maintaining downside resiliency; 2) The company/industry’s profitability will be better moving forward than it was pre-pandemic and therefore warrant a higher multiple; and/or 3) The company/industry was significantly mispriced before the pandemic. The first was true of Alaska Airlines pre-pandemic, but the certainty one can have about the second and third is not high enough to compel continued investment at today’s prices. The intended long-term position turned into a short-term trade with an exceptional IRR.”  6. Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR)  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33  Darling Ingredients Inc.

Overall, the leading integrated energy company now projects a significant sequential improvement in results for its three key business lines, considering the core operations.  The company projects operating results in the second quarter from the oil and liquids businesses to improve $600 million to $1 billion as compared to the March quarter of 2021, thanks to an uptick in oil prices. The change in natural gas prices is likely to have contributed another, a maximum of $400 million, to profits of the upstream business, as forecasted by the energy major. It is to be noted that the rolling out of coronavirus vaccines, which led to expectations that economies will rebound strongly later this year, primarily helped commodity prices move north in the June quarter of 2021.  Moreover, ExxonMobil estimated $500 million to $700 million of sequential improvement in contributions from the downstream business in the June quarter, thanks to improved refining margins. From the chemical business, the company estimated profit to increase $700 million to $900 million owing to a healthy chemicals margin.

Established financial companies Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) is an established financial institution that provides a range of financial services to corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals worldwide. It operates through four segments—Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer & Wealth Management. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) is one of the largest financial services companies in the world. It operates in four segments: Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management.  Despite the unabated low interest rate environment, most financial sector stocks have been rallying this year, with the reopening of economic activities driving the non-interest-generating components of their businesses. Even though benchmark interest rates are held near zero for now, the Fed has signaled two interest rate hikes as soon as late 2023, a year earlier than anticipated, and has raised its inflation forecast to 3.4%. This is good news for the financial sector because many financial stocks thrive with rising interest rates.  According to Globe Newswire, the global financial services market is expected to grow at a 9.9% CAGR to hit $22.5 trillion this year. Consequently, GS and JPM are expected to deliver significant returns in the coming quarters.  GS’ stock price has gained 77.5% over the past year, while JPM’s returned 61.8%. Also, GS’ 72.6% gains over the past nine months are significantly higher than JPM’s 48.3% returns. Furthermore, in terms of their past six months’ performance, GS is the clear winner with 23.7% gains versus JPM’s 11%.  Story continues  But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.  Latest Developments  On April 13, GS announced that it intended to expand its footprint in the U.K. by opening a new office in Birmingham. Richard Gnodde, the company’s CEO said, “Establishing a new office in Birmingham will diversify our U.K. footprint and give us access to a broad and deep talent pool in the local area. We see tremendous opportunity to enhance our U.K. presence and continue delivering for our global clients.”  JPM announced on June 29, 2021, that it had entered an agreement to acquire OpenInvest, a leading financial technology company that helps financial professionals customize and report on values-based investments. This is expected to expand the company’s portfolio of products and services in the sustainable investing space.

Its EPS is expected to grow 129.7% for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and 48.6% in fiscal 2021. JPM’s EPS is expected to grow at a 3% rate per annum over the next five years.  Profitability  JPM’s trailing-12-month revenue is 2.30 times what GS generates. JPM is also more profitable, with a 34.24% net income margin compared to GS’ 29.33%.

Advertisement  Square\'s Cash App has so much upside potential that buying shares in the fintech company today is anagolous to investing in JPMorgan at its founding in 1871, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev said in a note on Thursday.  ""We believe Cash App may be en route to becoming the ultimate neo-bank and the money center bank of the future,"" Dolev said.  The firm sees a visible path for Cash App products to more than quintuple its average revenue per user to $200, and estimates the money sending app can capture a large portion of the US bank account total addressable market of 400 to 500 million accounts, according to the note.  Dolev estimates that Square\'s Cash App currently has between 30 and 40 million users, and that legacy banks like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo generate average revenue per user between $400 and $700, implying lots of upside potential for Square\'s growth trajectory.  Advertisement  ""With vast potential upside to average revenue per user and users, we believe Cash App\'s gross profit could see 4x-8x growth over the coming years,"" Dolev explained, adding that it views Cash App as the ""ultimate challenger bank.""  The product fronts Dolev expects Square to tackle (and dominate) over the coming years includes retail crypto and stock trading, buy-now-pay-later, insurance, mortgage and auto loans, and tax services, among others, according to the note.  While the comparison between Square and JPMorgan in 1871 makes for a good headline, it\'s worth noting that the predecessor to America\'s largest bank didn\'t go public until 1942.  Mizuho reiterated its ""Buy"" rating on Square and set a price target of $380, representing potential upside of 59% from Wednesday\'s close.

Intuitive Surgical – Intuitive Surgical reported adjusted quarterly profit of $3.92 per share, compared with a $3.07 consensus estimate.

But its legal concerns have been growing -- the company now faces tens of thousands of lawsuits relating to its talc products alone. And while the healthcare giant has so far been able to handle its legal costs and remain profitable, in the future that may not be the case.  In addition, all this negative press isn\'t doing Johnson & Johnson\'s brand any favors. A constant barrage of recalls and lawsuits can cause real, long-term damage. Is this still an investable business, or have Johnson & Johnson\'s legal problems made this a stock to avoid at all costs?  The company\'s problems continue to mount  In recent years, Johnson & Johnson has been involved in many lawsuits. Here are a few of the more noteworthy items:  In 2020, a court fined the company $750 million for damages relating to four plaintiffs who claimed its baby powder products contained talc that led them to develop cancer. And the litigation isn\'t close to being over -- there are over 30,000 further plaintiffs that the business could potentially have to pay.  Multiple states have sued Johnson & Johnson for its role in the opioid crisis. Along with fellow defendants McKesson , Cardinal Health , and AmerisourceBergen , the company has been negotiating a settlement with state attorneys general that could top $26 billion (Johnson & Johnson\'s portion would be $5 billion). However, all parties haven\'t agreed on that, and it\'s still possible that the figure could go higher.  , , and , the company has been negotiating a settlement with state attorneys general that could top $26 billion (Johnson & Johnson\'s portion would be $5 billion). However, all parties haven\'t agreed on that, and it\'s still possible that the figure could go higher. Last year, a judge ordered the company to pay $344 million for misleading consumers about the safety of its pelvic mesh products.    Most recently, earlier this month the company issued a voluntary recall of some Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreen products. Although benzene, a known carcinogen, is not an ingredient, it was found in product testing. Johnson & Johnson is making the recall ""out of an abundance of caution.""  Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a second warning on Johnson & Johnson\'s coronavirus vaccine. It states the vaccine can increase the risk for a person to develop a neurological condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome. Previously, the agency had also issued a warning saying the vaccine increased the risk of blood clots. (The FDA has also issued warnings related to Pfizer and Moderna\'s COVID-19 vaccines, stating they increase the risk of heart inflammation.)  These issues haven\'t caused problems for Johnson & Johnson\'s financials -- yet  In both 2020 and 2019, Johnson & Johnson\'s litigation expense was more than $5 billion. However, in each of those years, the company\'s net earnings came in at about $15 billion. And as a percentage of revenue, the company has netted an 18% profit margin -- only slightly less than the 19% net margin it achieved in 2018.  From a strictly financial perspective, the business hasn\'t felt much of an effect on its bottom line as of yet. When Johnson & Johnson released its latest quarterly numbers on July 21, its profit for the period ending April 4 looked as strong as ever, coming in at over $6 billion.  But with more and more issues to worry about, it\'s certainly possible those litigation expenses could soar higher in the years ahead. And there are rumors that the company is looking ahead to potentially limit some of that liability. According to a report from Reuters, Johnson & Johnson is looking at dumping its liabilities related to its talc baby powder products into a new business and then putting that business into bankruptcy protection. The move would help to limit the company\'s legal obligations relating to that issue.  Why I would steer clear of Johnson & Johnson  Johnson & Johnson is an incredibly profitable company, and the stock is a Dividend King that you can likely count on for continued payments for the foreseeable future -- assuming, of course, that its legal bills don\'t start to erode its ability to meet those obligations. Right now, that doesn\'t appear to be an issue.  However, investors should be careful not to rely solely on past results or on the company\'s ability to weather the storm thus far. The more problems that come to light, the more potential there is for financial loss for the business in some form. We can\'t know whether there will be a specific straw that breaks the camel\'s back, and admittedly it looks highly unlikely right now that Johnson & Johnson won\'t be able to survive these challenges given its sheer size.  But simply surviving isn\'t going to make this a great investment. And there are also the intangibles to consider, such as the impact this bad press has on the company\'s future and whether it may lead to consumers switching to competing brands. That, combined with the potentially mounting legal costs, creates some long-term risk here that investors shouldn\'t simply ignore. And if the company looks to shirk its responsibility to consumers who have had serious health problems relating to its talc products, then that may turn off potential investors from an ethical standpoint.  While Johnson & Johnson is doing well right now, there are simply better options out there for investors, ones that don\'t possess nearly the same long-term risk.', 'Why did this happen?

Under the settlement proposal, distributors McKesson , Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen are expected to pay a combined $21 billion, while Johnson & Johnson would pay $5 billion.  The money from the distributors will be paid out over the next 18 years. J&J will pay over nine years, with up to $3.7 billion paid during the first three years.  The distributors were accused of lax controls that allowed massive amounts of addictive painkillers to be diverted into illegal channels, devastating communities, while J&J was accused of downplaying the addiction risk in its opioid marketing.  The companies have denied the allegations.  The settlement also calls for the creation of an independent clearinghouse to provide all three distributors and state regulators aggregated data about where drugs are going and how often, a tool negotiators hope will help reduce pills being over shipped to communities.  The ultimate amount the companies may have to pay will depend on the extent states sign up for the settlement and confirm their cities and counties are on board.  The opioid crisis has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of U.S. overdose deaths since 1999, but has hit some regions much harder than others, creating divisions among governments when it comes to evaluating the settlement.  At least 44 states must sign onto the deal to receive some of the money, and negotiators hope to gather more support, a person familiar with the matter said.']","['""My favorite name within the group is Visa,"" O\'Hara told CNBC\'s "" Trading Nation "" on Thursday. ""We are seeing Visa already consolidated and breaking out to new highs this week, so Visa to me is showing leadership within the space.""  JC O\'Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, says the entire space looks competitive and technically strong but one stock stands apart from the pack.  Rivals Mastercard and Visa were in the spotlight at Evercore. The firm bet that the return to global travel will be a positive for both companies.  Mizuho on Thursday restated its buy rating for Square , likening the stock to JPMorgan in the 1870s — a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in at the start.  O\'Hara says the setup reminds him of a similar breakout point in 2017.  ""Visa consolidated during most of 2016, early 2017, [then] broke to new highs. The structure is very similar to today, and we can see just how uninterrupted that bull run over 2017 was. So if we see any sort of run similar to 2017, we are in for some meaningful upside for Visa here,"" said O\'Hara.  Michael Binger, president of Gradient Investments, is bullish on the entire space and agrees with the calls made by Mizuho and Evercore.  ""We like the fintech space, we continue to like it. We think it\'s going to be a secular growth industry for a long time. The whole cash and check to digital, that\'s a trend that will go for quite some time. Cash App for Square and Venmo for PayPal are just going to continue to benefit this industry,"" Binger said during the same interview.  While he says comparing Square to JPMorgan is ""a bit of a stretch,"" he does believe the market has underestimated how much Square can grow. Square is expected to report 82% earnings growth for full year 2021, according to FactSet estimates. Sales are forecast to have more than doubled.  Legacy players Visa and Mastercard should also outperform, he said.  ""They just continue to benefit as the economy opens up, and I really think the next leg of growth there is really going to be that cross-border revenue when they open up internationally and people start traveling there,"" he said.

Once just a textile company, the Omaha-based holding company run by Warren Buffett expanded its business in the sectors of insurance, utility, renewable energy, freight rail transportation, and retail. Last month, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. made a $500 million investment in Brazil\'s most prominent digital bank, Nubank. Shares of BRK-A increased 54% in the last twelve months.  The company has a market cap of over $637 billion. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A)\'s first-quarter revenue grew 5% to $64.6 billion, up from $61.3 billion in the same quarter in 2020. In the previous year, the company\'s overall stock buybacks amounted to $24.7 billion.  At the end of the first quarter of 2021, institutional investor Vanguard Group Inc owned 135,790,660 shares in the firm worth $34.7 billion.

The investment portfolio has rebounded dramatically, the stock buyback pace accelerated in Q3 2020, and they have been more active in putting cash to work. Our material Berkshire purchases made earlier in the year, as the markets swooned and critics lambasted Berkshire, now look even better. A glance at some of Berkshire\'s recent new investments (Dominion\'s natural gas assets, Barrick Gold, EW Scripps, Snowflake, and a basket of Japanese trading companies) points to corporate culture, management team, and organization that continues to evolve. I\'m not surprised, but am glad to see the proof of that part of our thesis. Sadly, we all know that one way or another Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger\'s tenure at Berkshire will end one of these days. That time – whenever it is – is not the time to evaluate and react to how one feels about a post-Buffett/Munger Berkshire – that time was yesterday – which we have. Berkshire engenders a lot of criticism for perceived ""underperformance"". However, from mid-2015 through mid-2020 Berkshire\'s book value/share growth slightly beat a much riskier S&P 500, though the stock lagged. This is part of the opportunity. We estimate that Berkshire at present sells for only about 1.2x book value and materially below our estimate of intrinsic value using Mr. Buffett\'s ""five asset laden groves"" methodology.""  8.

In the Q4 2020 Investor Letter, Bretton Fund spoke about JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM). Here is what the fund said:  ""After a strong performance in 2019, we wrote this about our bank stocks in last year\'s report: ""There will be another recession sooner than later, and our banks will see larger loans losses, but we think this is more than priced into the stock, and our banks are well reserved for that eventuality."" Little did we know ""sooner"" really meant ""a few weeks from now."" Despite the economic shock, the banks still have huge capital cushions that can absorb large loan losses. Our remaining bank investments, JPMorgan and Bank of America, increased their reserves significantly at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis in anticipation of imminent loan defaults, but with the government stimulus and perhaps a more resilient economy than many would have guessed, actual loan losses are up only slightly. They might happen later in 2021, but with an additional stimulus package and the vaccine rolling out, the large-scale losses may not be as bad as most people predicted. The bigger drag on the bank\'s earnings power is lower rates, which in our opinion will persist for a long time. Despite this drag, we estimate both JPMorgan and Bank of America will continue to grow revenue and earnings over the next few years, while we believe their stocks remain bargains in a somewhat expensive market. JPMorgan\'s earnings per share declined 17% last year, and its stock returned -5.5%. Bank of America\'s earnings, which are more sensitive to interest rates, were down 32%, and its stock returned -11.6%.""  Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Vanguard Stocks to Buy Now.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States on July 28 asked Americans who had been vaccinated against the coronavirus to start wearing masks in public indoor spaces again. The announcement follows a dramatic rise in the number of Delta variant cases of COVID-19 in parts of the country and reverses an earlier position by the health body that said vaccinated people did not need to wear masks indoors. The U-turn has naturally sparked fears of another wave of the virus hitting the US and shuttering business.  Over the past few weeks, virus lockdown fears coupled with inflation worries have battered the stock market, dampening hopes of a quick recovery from the 2020 lockdowns. On July 19, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 725 points, representing a percentage decrease of over 2%, and the weekly relative strength indicator of the S&P 500 also dropped by about 0.47%. Investors are thus taking the necessary precautions and offloading shares of cyclical stocks to invest in firms that can weather the coming storm.  Some of the best bear market stocks on the market presently include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP), among others. These are discussed in detail below. Airlines, cruise operators, and energy firms are beating the brunt of this activity. Coupled with the Chinese government crackdown against dual-listed firms, some of which do roaring business in the US, there is little doubt that the some parts of the stock market is now officially in the bear market after a record bull run over the past few months.  The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices.

(NYSE: AN) stock to $110 from $100 but kept a Hold rating on the stock, underlining the earnings beat of the firm and noting the favorable supply-demand dynamics heading into 2022.  Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Ricky Sandler's Eminence Capital is the leading shareholder of AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN) with 1.5 million shares worth more than $139.7 million.  11. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT)  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) stock has returned 5.4% to investors in the past six months. It is placed eleventh on our list of 12 best bear market stocks to buy now. The firm operates from Maryland and markets security and aerospace services.

Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) with 1.5 million shares worth more than $590 million.  In its Q4 2020 investor letter, RiverPark Advisors, LLC, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:  “Despite better-than-expected third quarter results, LMT shares were weak for the quarter as defense spending is expected to be flat for the coming year. With a record $150 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year in 4-5 years (3Q’s revenue upside was from the F-35), we believe LMT should grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years. Further, strategic acquisitions (LMT acquired AJRD for $4 billion in late December), debt pay down, a 3% dividend yield, and continued share buybacks from $6 billion per year of free cash flow should lead to even greater shareholder returns.”  10. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST)  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) is a firm that owns and operates membership-only retail stores around the world. It is based in Washington. The stock has returned more than 32% to investors over the course of the past twelve months. The company has a market cap of over $189 billion and posted more than $166 billion in revenue last year. Apart from being one of the largest retail outlets in the world, the firm also boasts a large retail sale of meat products like beef and rotisserie chicken. On July 23, investment advisory Stifel maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) stock and raised the price target to $440 from $420, noting that it expected the retailer to raise membership fees by at least 8% in the next twelve months. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 56 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4 billion in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST), down from 61 in the preceding quarter worth $3.6 billion. In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Ensemble Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:  “We saw these dynamics at play in the Fund. Some of the worst-performing stocks this quarter were among our best performers in Q1 2020. Another example was the market’s reaction to Costco Wholesale (1.5% weight in the Fund) during the quarter. From December 31, 2020 to March 8th, Costco shares declined 17% and dropped below their pre-pandemic high. The common rationale offered by sell-side analysts was that Costco would face difficult one-year “comps” (i.e. same-store sales, which compare sales from stores open for at least a year). Because so many consumers rushed to Costco ahead of shelter-in-place and subsequent quarantines, it will be harder for Costco to meaningfully beat those results when compared year-over-year. That may indeed be true, but we struggle to understand how Costco could be “less valuable” than it was a year earlier when it concurrently increased its membership base by over 7%, or 3.9 million members. With membership renewal rates around 90%, the vast majority of the new customers Costco brought in last year will be around for years to come. Analysts also complained about Costco raising its already industry-leading minimum wage to $16/hour, with an average “effective” pay of $23-$24/hour when you include overtime and bonuses. Costco paying its employees “too much” has been a common gripe of Wall Street analysts for at least two decades. While the extra pay does indeed impact short-term profit margins, it also serves to make Costco more durable, as its flywheel (i.e. a virtuous value cycle) starts with happy employees. A 20-year chart of Costco stock price is evidence that this strategy works and we’re confident that it will continue to work.”  9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO)  Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company. It is ranked ninth on our list of 12 best bear market stocks to buy now. The company’s shares have returned 18% to investors over the past year.

""We are seeing Visa already consolidated and breaking out to new highs this week, so Visa to me is showing leadership within the space.""  JC O\'Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, says the entire space looks competitive and technically strong but one stock stands apart from the pack.  Rivals Mastercard and Visa were in the spotlight at Evercore. The firm bet that the return to global travel will be a positive for both companies.  Mizuho on Thursday restated its buy rating for Square , likening the stock to JPMorgan in the 1870s — a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in at the start.  O\'Hara says the setup reminds him of a similar breakout point in 2017.  ""Visa consolidated during most of 2016, early 2017, [then] broke to new highs. The structure is very similar to today, and we can see just how uninterrupted that bull run over 2017 was. So if we see any sort of run similar to 2017, we are in for some meaningful upside for Visa here,"" said O\'Hara.  Michael Binger, president of Gradient Investments, is bullish on the entire space and agrees with the calls made by Mizuho and Evercore.  ""We like the fintech space, we continue to like it. We think it\'s going to be a secular growth industry for a long time. The whole cash and check to digital, that\'s a trend that will go for quite some time. Cash App for Square and Venmo for PayPal are just going to continue to benefit this industry,"" Binger said during the same interview.  While he says comparing Square to JPMorgan is ""a bit of a stretch,"" he does believe the market has underestimated how much Square can grow. Square is expected to report 82% earnings growth for full year 2021, according to FactSet estimates. Sales are forecast to have more than doubled.  Legacy players Visa and Mastercard should also outperform, he said.  ""They just continue to benefit as the economy opens up, and I really think the next leg of growth there is really going to be that cross-border revenue when they open up internationally and people start traveling there,"" he said.

Earning credit card points, miles, or cash back on rewards and cash-back cards is one of the easiest ways to put a little extra money back in your budget. In fact, with the sign-up bonuses and high earn rates on the best Canadian credit cards, it’s not rare for the average Canadian to bring in $500 to $1,000 in rewards in a single year.  But if you’re earning that much, you might wonder if the CRA considers that money taxable income. After all, they consider tips, gift cards for services performed, and ride shares as taxable income. Why not credit card rewards?  As it turns out, they are taxable — for a small portion of Canadians. Let’s take a look at when credit card rewards are considered taxable and when they’re not.  When are credit card rewards not taxable income?  Fortunately, the majority of Canadian consumers don’t have to pay taxes on their credit card rewards. As long as you’re earning points, miles, or cash back for personal purchases (i.e., not for business purchases), the CRA will look at them as discounts and coupons, not income. Much like you don’t report savings from grocery coupons, you won’t report your credit card rewards on your tax filing.  When are credit card rewards considered taxable income?  Things become a bit tricky when you earn points, miles, or cash back for business or work-related purchases. If you redeem them for cash, you might have to pay taxes.  For example, let’s say your company sends you to Toronto for a work-related conference. You use your credit card to buy a plane ticket, earning 400 miles in the process. Your company is going to reimburse the cost of the flight, which means you just earned 400 miles basically for nothing.  If you keep those miles as miles — that is, if you redeem them for flights or travel purchases in the future — the CRA won’t consider them taxable income. But if you redeem those 400 miles for cash, then you’d have to pay taxes on them. On your tax filing, you would declare the cash value of the miles, adding them to your taxable income.  To be clear, if you keep your points in your original form, you don’t have to pay taxes on them. It’s only when you convert points or miles from work-related expenses into cash that you have to pay taxes on them.  There’s one last instance that might trigger a tax event. Let’s go back to our example: you’re going to Toronto for a work-related conference. Let’s say you’ve been crushing it at work, and your employer wants to give you extra compensation. They tell you that you can use your rewards credit card to buy every employee’s plane ticket to the conference (let’s say there are 10). If you buy 10 plane tickets, you could earn 4,000 miles, which seems like a pretty good deal to you.  In that event, the CRA would consider the extra miles as taxable income, no matter if you convert them to cash or miles. Your employer would have to report their fair market value of the rewards on box 14 of your T4 slip. When you file your taxes, you would include this fair market value in your taxable income.  This is also true if your employer gives your miles, points, or cash back as an annual bonus. If they’re gifted to you, then you have to report them as taxable income.  Do you have to report your credit card rewards?  Unless you earn points for work-related expenditures, and unless you redeem those points for cash, your credit card rewards are not considered taxable income. If you’re unsure, you can talk to your tax advisor about whether or not you should report your rewards.']","['Empty vials of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine are seen at a first come first serve drive-thru vaccination site operated by the Lake County Health Department on January 28, 2021 in Groveland, Florida.  Pfizer said Wednesday it sold $7.8 billion in Covid-19 shots in the second quarter and raised its 2021 sales forecast for the vaccine to $33.5 billion from $26 billion, as the delta variant spreads and scientists debate whether people will need booster shots.  The company\'s second-quarter financial results also beat Wall Street expectations on earnings and revenue. Here\'s how Pfizer did compared with what Wall Street expected, according to average estimates compiled by Refinitiv:  Adjusted earnings per share: $1.07 per share vs. 97 cents per share expected  Revenue: $18.98 billion vs. $18.74 billion forecast  Pfizer expects an adjusted pretax profit in the high 20% range of revenue for the vaccine.  The company now expects full-year earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4.05 per share. That\'s up from its prior range of $3.55 to $3.65 per share. It expects revenue in the range of $78 billion to $80 billion, up from its previous estimate of $70.5 billion to $72.5 billion.  Shares of Pfizer rose 2.5% in intraday trading.  ""The second quarter was remarkable in a number of ways,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. ""Most visibly, the speed and efficiency of our efforts with BioNTech to help vaccinate the world against COVID-19 have been unprecedented, with now more than a billion doses of BNT162b2 having been delivered globally.""  Pfizer\'s other business units also saw strong sales growth. Revenue from its oncology unit rose by 19% year over year to $3.1 billion. The company\'s hospital unit generated $2.2 billion in revenue, up 21% from the prior year. Its internal medicine unit grew by 5% from a year ago to $2.4 billion.  Pfizer said earlier this month it was seeing signs of waning immunity induced by its Covid vaccine with German drugmaker BioNTech, and planned to ask the Food and Drug Administration to authorize a booster dose. It also said it is developing a booster shot to target the delta variant.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization don\'t recommend Covid booster shots at this time.  Dr. Kate O\'Brien, WHO\'s director of immunization, vaccines and biologicals, said Wednesday the organization is still researching whether a booster shot is needed to increase protection.  ""We\'re very clear on this, there\'s not enough information to provide a recommendation at this point,"" O\'Brien said in a Q&A interview posted on the organization\'s social media accounts. ""Again, this is a very hot topic, and there\'s a lot of research going on to be able to provide an evidence-based recommendation.""  During Pfizer\'s post-earnings conference call Wednesday, executives said they continue to believe people will need a third dose of the vaccine within 12 months to maintain its high level of protection against the virus. But with delta spreading in several countries, Bourla said some people might need a third shot ""a little earlier.""  In slides posted Wednesday alongside its earnings report, Pfizer said it could potentially file for an emergency use authorization for a booster dose with the FDA as early as August. It expects to begin clinical studies testing its delta variant vaccine in the same month.  ""We are in ongoing discussion with regulatory agencies regarding a potential third dose booster of the current vaccine and, assuming positive results, anticipate an emergency use authorization as early as August,"" Pfizer\'s Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten told investors.  It expects full approval for its two-dose vaccine by January 2022.  On the earnings call, Bourla said it is ""too early"" to discuss the outlook for 2022, but noted the company has vaccine agreements with multiple countries.', 'Most companies don\'t make it to the ripe old age of 172. If they do, they usually don\'t become one of the most talked-about organizations in the world. But most companies aren\'t Pfizer (PFE -0.40%).  The big drugmaker helped change the world for the better with the COVID-19 vaccine that it developed with partner BioNTech. Thanks mainly to this vaccine, Pfizer ranks as the most popular healthcare stock among Robinhood investors. It\'s also in the top seven companies in the world with the best corporate reputation.  However, if I had to pick one thing other than its COVID-19 vaccine that makes Pfizer stand out, my vote would be for its dividend. Here are three things every investor should know about Pfizer\'s dividend.  1. It offers one of the most attractive yields in the healthcare sector  There are nearly 1,200 stocks in the healthcare sector. Only six of them have dividend yields that are higher than Pfizer\'s yield of 3.9%.  Dividend yield is simply the percentage of annual dividends paid divided by the stock price. Yield goes up as the stock goes down and vice versa. This inverse relationship makes Pfizer\'s dividend yield stand out even more. Why? Over the last 12 months, its share price has risen more than any of the six healthcare stocks with higher dividend yields.  Pfizer\'s COVID-19 vaccine was certainly a key factor behind the stock outperforming the other top healthcare dividend stocks. However, the company\'s merger of its Upjohn unit with Mylan late last year also likely helped. The deal moved a basket of low- and no-growth drugs that have lost exclusivity out of Pfizer\'s lineup.  2. It\'s dependable  Where were you in 1938? Many of us weren\'t even alive at that point. Pfizer, though, was already a major drugmaker that paid dividends to its shareholders. And it\'s paid a dividend every quarter since then. When the company\'s third-quarter dividend is distributed in September, it will mark the 331st consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Pfizer.  With that kind of track record, it\'s fair to say that Pfizer\'s dividend is dependable. Granted, the company did cut its dividend payout back in 2009. This move was made in connection with Pfizer\'s acquisition of Wyeth. However, the company quickly returned to its previous practice of annual dividend hikes.  Pfizer initially thought that it would reduce its dividend slightly due to the spin-off of Upjohn. There wouldn\'t have been a net effect for the company\'s shareholders prior to the transaction, though, because Viatris, the new entity created from the merger of Upjohn and Mylan, initiated its own dividend.  Ultimately, though, Pfizer didn\'t have to cut its dividend at all. The massive sales for its COVID-19 vaccine enabled the company to keep the dividend at its previous level despite losing the cash flow that had been generated by Upjohn.  3. It\'s likely to increase  The odds appear to be pretty good that Pfizer\'s dividend will increase going forward. For one thing, the company\'s management team remains committed to the dividend program. In Pfizer\'s first-quarter conference call, CFO Frank D\'Amelio said that annual dividend increases were expected to continue ""for the foreseeable future.""  It\'s a lot easier for a company to boost its dividend payout when its earnings are growing. And that seems likely to happen for Pfizer. Wall Street analysts project that the drugmaker\'s earnings will increase by an average of more than 11.5% annually over the next five years.  The emergence of new coronavirus variants, including the highly transmissible delta variant, could fuel increased and sustained demand for Pfizer\'s COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer\'s lineup also includes several other products with strong sales growth, such as blood thinner Eliquis, transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy drug Vyndaqel, autoimmune disease drug Xeljanz, and prostate cancer drug Xtandi.  Over the longer term, Pfizer could see even more growth from its pipeline candidates. As of early May, the company had 99 experimental drugs in clinical development, including 22 late-stage programs.  A little something extra  In Louisiana, there\'s a tradition known as lagniappe. It\'s where you get a little something extra thrown in. With this practice in mind, I\'ll give you one additional thing to know about Pfizer\'s dividend.  If you had owned shares of Pfizer over the last 10 years and reinvested the dividends, your total return would have been almost twice the returns the stock generated without dividend reinvestment. Pfizer\'s dividend could provide a lot of something extra for investors who buy and hold the big pharma stock.', ""Before putting money in your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), it’s probably better to contribute to your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) first.  That said, the RRSP is perfect for investing in U.S. dividend stocks. It is an excellent tool for saving and investing for retirement because, in most cases, withdrawals will count as taxable income. This deters Canadians from taking money out of their RRSPs, helping serve the purpose of saving for retirement.  Since RRSP/RRIF withdrawals count as taxable income in your retirement, you’ll want to aim for total returns while being comfortable with your retirement account investments. You can take advantage of tremendous tax savings by investing in these top stocks in your RRSP.  Invest in big-dividend stocks in the U.S.  The dividends from U.S. stocks are not as tax friendly as Canadian eligible dividends, which allow Canadians to enjoy a dividend tax credit. There’s a 15% withholding tax on dividends paid from U.S. corporations to Canadians. However, this tax is exempt in the RRSP. Therefore, you would want to save RRSP room to invest in big-dividend U.S. stocks.  What’s considered a big dividend? The U.S. stock market yields about 1.3%. And the market is relatively expensive compared to historical levels. So, you might seek U.S. dividend stocks that provide a minimum yield of 2.6% — double the market yield.  Pfizer and Merck are blue-chip big-dividend U.S. stocks you can explore. They provide yields of 3.9% and 3.4%, respectively. The reasonably valued healthcare stocks and steady growth should lead to returns that at least match the market’s while providing above-average income.  You can also investigate telecoms AT&T and Verizon as a potential U.S. big-dividend income investment. They offer massive yields of about 7.3% and 4.5%, respectively.  The tax on income from U.S. stocks that are master limited partnerships (MLPs) are taxed differently. You might need to pay taxes on the income from these stocks, even if they reside in your RRSP. If you plan to invest in MLPs, talk to a tax professional first.  Story continues  Buy growth stocks in your RRSP  The price gains expected from growth stocks can lead to big tax bills down the road. Therefore, if you run out of room in your TFSA, you might use some of your RRSP room for growth stocks.  The goal of growth stocks is total returns that primarily come from price appreciation. So, any growth stocks you are bullish on, whether they are listed on the Canadian or U.S. stock exchanges could be a candidate for purchase.  Here are some large-cap growth stock ideas you can do more research on to determine they fit your growth portfolio. They include Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Shopify, and Tencent.  The chart below displays the growth of a $10,000 investment from five years ago in each stock. Notably, the Shopify stock investment is based on the TSX listing, not the NYSE.  BABA Chart  Data by YCharts.  The worst investment, Alibaba stock, delivered annualized returns of about 21%, which actually wasn’t bad at all, given the long-term market returns are about 10%. The best investment was Netflix stock, and its annualized returns were nearly 42% per year!  You can also invest in small- or mid-cap growth stocks. However, they often experience bigger corrections than more stable large-cap growth stocks. Therefore, they would require a more active investing approach — perhaps taking at least partial profit on rallies.

Pfizer's market value totaled about $200 billion. And at its lowest point last spring, Tesla's market cap dipped to $84 billion.  A lot has happened since then. Pfizer became the first to commercialize a coronavirus vaccine -- and that vaccine is generating billions of dollars in revenue. And Tesla delivered of a half a million cars in 2020. So far, investors have rewarded Tesla more than they've rewarded Pfizer. Tesla's market cap soared 794% last year -- well surpassing that of Pfizer. Now the question is whether the pharmaceutical company can transform strong revenue into share gains -- and top Tesla's market value.  Pfizer versus Tesla  First, let's look at Pfizer's market value growth so far compared with that of Tesla. Pfizer's value has remained in the $200 billion range for the past 20 years. Historically, Tesla's value has been much lower. But the company showed its ability to win over investors -- and quickly -- last year. Market value skyrocketed -- and now totals about $622 billion.  If Tesla continues growing -- even at a slower pace -- it will be tough to beat. But let's make things simple and use today's market cap figure. So the idea is: Can Pfizer reach a market cap of about $622 billion over the coming four years?  The fundamentals paint a bright picture. Pfizer is the coronavirus vaccine leader. It's vaccinated the biggest share of the U.S. population. And in the European Union, the company recently won a contract to supply as many as 1.8 billion vaccine doses through 2023. That's after an earlier contract for 600 million doses to be delivered this year. Pfizer expects the vaccine to generate $26 billion in revenue in 2021. Of course, it splits profits with partner BioNTech. But this still represents a blockbuster level product for Pfizer. In fact, the company said the vaccine will account for 36% of its revenue this year.  Contracts -- such as the one with Europe -- indicate the company can count on vaccine revenue beyond this year. Experts also have confirmed this, saying the coronavirus is here to stay. And Pfizer's CEO has said we probably should expect vaccinations on an annual basis.  More good news  Here's more good news for Pfizer: It doesn't rely only on the coronavirus vaccine for revenue. The big pharma company has several other growing products such as heart failure drug Vyndaqel and anticoagulant Eliquis. Their sales rose 88% and 25%, respectively, in the first quarter.  All of this is contributing to higher revenue on the horizon. The midpoint of Pfizer's full-year forecast represents a 71% increase in revenue year over year. The company predicts $70.5 billion to $72.5 billion in revenue this year.  How has Pfizer's vaccine leadership -- and growth in other products -- translated into market cap and share price growth so far? Over the past year, both are up about 17%.  That's not a huge move. Especially considering the world's focus on coronavirus vaccines. Biotech companies in the vaccine race saw much bigger gains. For example, Moderna's share price and market cap have risen more than 200% in the same time period.  Pfizer's market cap would have to increase 178% to reach Tesla's current market cap. Considering the growth in valuation we've seen so far, I'm not convinced Pfizer will surpass Tesla in the next few years. Past performance shows that even over the past 10 years, Pfizer's market value only climbed 50%.  What does this mean for investors?  Pfizer may not see its market value multiply at the speed of light. But the stock still represents a sure and steady play for long-term investors. Overall revenue is on the rise thanks to a broad array of commercialized products. And the coronavirus vaccine seems to be in the early days of its revenue story. It's important to keep in mind that future boosters and use in younger age groups should add to orders and sales. Of course, Pfizer probably won't leave Tesla in the dust. But this pharma stock still is likely to drive the value of your investment higher over time.""]","[""Your best friend in long-term investing is compound growth .  If you're looking for truly life-changing wealth, you need to hold top-performing stocks for a long period of time. The best way to do this is to simply find high-quality companies and let compounding interest work its magic. Early investors to stocks like Starbucks (SBUX 0.96%), Nike (NKE -0.37%), and Home Depot (HD 2.05%) know this well. Each one of these stocks has turned $10,000 invested in its IPO into more than $1 million today.  Let's take a closer look to see how that happened to each one.  1. Starbucks  Starbucks today is the world's biggest coffee chain and the second-largest restaurant business behind McDonald's. In 1992, when the company IPO'd, it was much smaller and only beginning to gain traction in the U.S. Starbucks had just 165 stores that year. However, CEO Howard Schultz had found a transformative idea: Bring the Italian café experience to the U.S. That idea not only made Starbucks a huge success but also spawned a new industry of coffee shops serving espresso drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.  Today, Starbucks has more than 30,000 stores around the world. It's growing quickly in China and has become a mainstay on supermarket shelves and convenience stores in addition to its ubiquitous café business. The company has faced challenges along the way, including after Schultz stepped down in the 2000s and its cafés became commoditized. But the stock has been a monster throughout most of its history.  According to the chart below, the stock has gained nearly 35,000% since its 1992 debut.  Along the way, the company has split its stock by 2-for-1 six times, meaning an IPO investor would hold 64 shares for every one they held in 1992. In other words, the $17 share back then is now 64 shares worth $117 each, or about $7,500. By that math, $10,000 invested in Starbucks' 1992 IPO would be worth more than $4 million currently, and that doesn't even factor in the dividends the company began paying in 2010.  2. Nike  Much like Starbucks, Nike was still in its relative infancy when the stock debuted in 1980. At the time, Nike was a scrappy running shoe company. Converse dominated, and no one had heard of Michael Jordan. As far as streetwear, Adidas was the leader.  That all changed with the help of Jordan's superstardom, the Air Jordan line, the elevation of basketball and the NBA on the global stage, and the evolution of sneakers as high fashion and a staple of streetwear.  Today, Nike commands an enviable roster of athletes, including LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Cristiano Ronaldo, and it's developed a direct-to-consumer business that's accelerating innovation, expanding its profit margins, giving it more control of the customer experience, and adding value for it customers.  There's no deep secret to Nike's success. A combination of savvy marketing, smart product innovation and design, and the rise of sports in the broader culture have all propelled Nike to where it is today.  Since the 1980 IPO, the stock has appreciated more than 88,000%.  The sportswear giant has issued seven 2-for-1 splits since 1980, meaning 1 share back then would now be 128 shares at a current stock price of $159. In other words, the IPO share that was just $10.50 is now worth more than $20,000. Using that math, $10,000 invested in Nike's IPO would today be worth nearly $20 million. That also does not include dividends, which the company began paying in 2004.  3. Home Depot  Home improvement retailer Home Depot IPO'd in 1981 just three years after its founding. Back then, the company had just a few stores in the Atlanta area but embraced a philosophy similar to Walmart in general merchandise. Home Depot opened cavernous warehouses, dwarfing the typical hardware store, offered low prices, and staffed its stores with knowledgeable employees who could assist customers in all manner of do-it-yourself (DIY) home-improvement projects. That big-box store model, economies of scale, and emphasis on DIY and customer-service professionals have proven to be a winning combination for Home Depot especially as home prices have boomed over the last generation.  Today, Home Depot is the leader in what is effectively a duopoly in home-improvement retail along with Lowe's. The company has more than 2,000 stores and a high-margin business that allows it to reinvest in areas like supply chain, technology, and omnichannel fulfillment, and return cash to investors through dividends and share repurchases.  Since its IPO, Home Depot has been one of the best-performing stocks on the market, increasing more than 1,500,000%.  Home Depot has had 13 stock splits over its history, ranging from 2-for-1 to 5-for-4. If you bought one share of the stock for its IPO price for $12 a share, it would now be equal to 342 shares worth about $111,000. Had you invested $10,000 at that IPO price, it would be valued at a whopping $92.5 million today. With that return, you could have invested just $100 and come away a millionaire, especially when factoring in dividends.  All three of these stocks show how compound growth can work wonders in investing. If you can find the next Home Depot or Nike when they're still small, you could become a millionaire with just a small investment."", 'In this article LOW  HD Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT  Home Depot has a flatbed distribution center in the Dallas area. It is opening more of the facilities across the country to help fulfill home professionals\' large orders. Melissa Repko, CNBC  In a giant warehouse in Dallas, a fleet of forklifts carries big and bulky home improvement supplies from drywall and concrete to lumber. Box cars cut though the giant facility on a rail line. Trucks pull up, ready to be loaded. Home Depot \'s facility — which could fit about 14 professional football fields— is helping the company speed up the replenishment of store shelves and deliver purchases to customers\' doors. It is a key part of the retailer\'s strategy to win more business from electricians, remodelers and other home professionals, particularly ones that place big orders. The pandemic fueled a hot real estate market and a penchant for ""nesting,"" creating tailwinds for Home Depot and Lowe\'s . As Covid-19 cases fall in the U.S. and homeowners spend more time on planes or at parties, the biggest business opportunity is sales growth from home professionals. Home Depot has historically drawn more of its business from these more lucrative and frequent shoppers, but Lowe\'s is trying to attract more pros, too. About 45% of Home Depot\'s total sales come from pro customers versus about 20% to 25% at Lowe\'s, according to the companies. In recent months, executives at both companies have said they are seeing pent-up demand for professional projects as people feel comfortable inviting contractors back into their homes and dine out and travel more instead of ticking off a list of do-it-yourself projects. ""In talking to the pro, they all have very strong books of business,"" Home Depot president and chief operating officer Ted Decker said. ""They all have backlogs."" The home-improvement retailers will have to make sure they have plenty of inventory to take advantage of that demand, even as supply chain challenges — such as congested ports — delay shipments.  A customer wearing a protective mask loads lumber at a Home Depot store in Pleasanton, California, on Monday, Feb. 22, 2021. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images  Chasing bigger customers  For years, Home Depot has positioned itself as a convenient alternative to ordering from specialty suppliers for pros. It has doubled down on that with a $1.2 billion supply chain investment, which includes opening a network of flatbed distribution centers like the one in Dallas. Four have opened so far in Dallas, Baltimore, Miami and Newark, New Jersey, and three more are opening later this year in Atlanta, Houston and Tampa, Florida. Each facility can hold a huge amount of inventory, such as a wider array of shingles, and deliver orders directly to a project site. With the massive facilities, Decker said Home Depot is chasing larger professionals that only shop with the company on occasion. ""An individual contractor or a father-son team, we might have virtually all of their wallet,"" he said. ""The bigger the pro gets, though, we tend to be more of the fill-in purchase. They are obtaining their principal material requirement for a larger job from one of these disparate competitors."" Home Depot recently added to its pro business with the acquisition of HD Supply, a large distributor of appliances, plumbing and electrical equipment, for about $8 billion. It had previously spun off the company. Decker said Home Depot anticipates the biggest year-over-year growth numbers will come from pros in the coming quarters, particularly after a year when construction sites shut down, consumers postponed remodels, and DIY projects soared. Growth of the pro side of Home Depot\'s business outpaced the DIY side for the first time in a year in the first quarter, which ended May 2, Decker said. Combined, same-store sales grew 31% in the quarter. At Lowe\'s, growth of pro sales also surpassed DIY sales in the first quarter with gains of more than 30% year over year. Combined with DIY, same-store sales grew by nearly 26% in the quarter.  A customer pushes a shopping cart towards the entrance of a Lowe\'s store in Concord, California, on Tuesday, Feb. 23, 2021. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images  \'The pick-up truck pro\'  For Lowe\'s, revving up the pro business has been a piece of CEO Marvin Ellison\'s turnaround plan. He has said Lowe\'s sweet spot is ""the pick-up truck pro"" rather than large companies. It has rolled out services and perks that resemble ones that Home Depot already had — such as tool rental and a loyalty program with members-only benefits. It has also added new brands and rearranged store merchandise, so items needed for the same project are in one place rather than scattered across different aisles, freeing up pros\' time. Lowe\'s senior vice president of pro sales and services Fred Stokes said those recent investments are already paying off. In a statement, he said Lowe\'s has attracted new pros and grown wallet share among existing ones. He said it has ""heard from many of our Pros that they appreciate other changes they are seeing.""  A construction worker remodels a home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Suzanne Kreiter | The Boston Globe | Getty Images  A fragmented market, growing pie  Lowe\'s is gaining ground, but it\'s still playing catch-up, D.A. Davidson retail analyst Michael Baker said. He said the entire difference in sales per store at the two home improvement retailers comes from the gap in the size of the pro businesses. Sales per average store at Home Depot and Lowe\'s in 2020 were $57.6 million and $45.4 million, respectively, according to D.A. Davidson estimates. That comes from the wide gap in its pro sales per store: $24.2 million at Home Depot versus $9.5 million at Lowe\'s. However, he said Lowe\'s has the bigger opportunity. He rates Home Depot shares as neutral, with a price target of $317 — below its $322.70 closing price on Friday. On the other hand, he rates Lowe\'s shares as buy and his price target is $217, above its Friday close of $195.71. ""Lowe\'s DIY business is just as strong as Home Depot\'s,"" Baker said. ""So theoretically there\'s no reason why their pro business shouldn\'t be. They just need to invest and build it up over time."" Edward Jones senior research analyst Brian Yarbrough said the competition between the two is not a ""zero-sum game."" Home Depot and Lowe\'s have a varied mix of rivals that range from local mom-and-pop hardware stores to specialty retailers like lumberyards and electrical supply companies. That fragmented market allows them to scoop up new customers, along with poaching them from one another, he said. Plus, home values are rising and that\'s inspiring remodeling projects. Baker said that means a bigger pro market for both retailers. ""The overall pie is growing,"" he said.', 'The price of lumber surged during the pandemic. Suppliers miscalculated the effect of the pandemic on demand for their products. Rather than falling off, demand surged as people stuck at home took to home improvement projects.  The boost in demand coupled with reductions in supply sent prices of lumber up to $1,690 per 1,000 board feet in May of this year from a low of $240 at the end of March 2020. Since hitting that high in May, prices have come crashing back down and sit at $581 per 1,000 board feet as of this writing.  Lumber is vital for many of the projects that people go to Home Depot (HD 2.05%) and Lowe\'s (LOW 1.21%) for. Therefore, drastic price changes could cause consumers to change their buying decisions.  Lumber inflation is fueling revenue increases  Interestingly, as the price of lumber was rising, Home Depot and Lowe\'s were raising prices they charge customers, and so far, those higher prices have not decreased demand. Perhaps it\'s because people feel wealthier after several rounds of stimulus checks have hit their bank accounts since the pandemic. Or it could be that people are spending a lot more time at home lately and see a higher return on investment on their home improvement projects.  Regardless, both Home Depot and Lowe\'s have said that rising commodity prices have helped juice their sales as they have passed along the price increases to their customers. Home Depot said, ""Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 375 basis points during the first quarter.""  Similarly, Lowe\'s said, ""Strong sales growth was driven by several factors, including a continued consumer focus on the home, a favorable weather backdrop across the country, commodity inflation, especially within the lumber category, consumer support from the March government stimulus package ... ""  Given that both companies are experiencing rapid sales growth since the pandemic onset, it\'s hard to say their sales could have been better if lumber prices remained lower. You may already be aware that lower prices tend to increase unit sales. However, when you are already selling nearly every unit you have on the shelf, lower prices cannot increase unit sales.  That may not be the case for home improvement retailers any longer.  Good timing  The U.S. vaccination campaign got off to a fast start and, even though it has slowed down recently, over 342 million doses have been administered. As a result, states have eased business restrictions, and people have more options for what they can do with their time and money. Further, it\'s been several months since the last stimulus check was sent, so consumers will have less money at their disposal.  The decrease in lumber prices comes at an opportune time when the consumer is likely to become more price-conscious. And with more options for where they can spend their money, inventories are not likely to be as constrained as they were during the pandemic. The result could be that lower prices cause people to take on projects they previously put on hold because they were too expensive to complete.  It can help the home improvement retailers to have a soft slowdown from the turbocharged growth rates during the pandemic. And in the longer run, sustained low levels of lumber prices could increase home building and subsequently homeownership, which would be great news for Home Depot and Lowe\'s.']","['Customers shop for produce at a supermarket on June 10, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois. Inflation rose 5% in the 12-month period ending in May, the biggest jump since August 2008. Food prices rose 2.2 percent for the same period.  As U.S. stocks plummeted Monday, investors bet on a familiar category that could grow if Covid-19 cases continue to rise: Grocery stores.  Shares of Kroger , Albertsons , BJ\'s Wholesale Club were up as of midday Monday. Costco touched an all-time high of $415.32.  Those stocks were among the rare bright spots on Wall Street, as the Dow Jones Industrial average appears headed for its biggest drop of the year. Several other stay-at-home stocks, including Clorox and Peloton , were also in the green.  Grocers have been some of the biggest pandemic beneficiaries over the past year, as restaurants temporarily shut and shoppers stocked up on pantry staples and cooked at home.  The retailers face tough comparisons in the coming quarters, as they go up against unusually high sales growth numbers. Investors and companies have been trying to figure out when — and to what extent — consumers will return to their dining out habits, as more people are fully vaccinated and restrictions ease. In recent weeks, however, the rise of the delta variant of Covid-19 — particularly in parts of the country with low vaccination rates — has complicated those predictions.  Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst for Edward Jones, said investors are getting spooked by news of the delta variant and the rollback of the reopening in some parts of the country — such as the return of indoor mask mandates in Los Angeles. He said that is causing some to flock back to tried-and-true pandemic names.  ""You have seen a flight to more safety,"" he said. ""If this plays out and Covid starts to rear it\'s head again and things start to shut down, you\'d see grocery benefit from that.""  Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson, said grocers\' pop on the market is ""the reverse of what you\'re seeing with airline stocks."" As of midday Monday, airlines and cruises were among the hardest hit sectors as investors worried travel trends may slow or reverse.  Grocery sales are still above pre-pandemic levels, according to data from IRI, which tracks sales patterns across supermarkets, big-box retailers and convenience stores. Total demand for consumer packaged goods was about the same as year-ago levels for the week ending July 4, though sales of perishables and total non-edible items fell slightly.  Baker said some people have formed new habits over the past year, as they cooked more. Plus, he said a shortage of labor has dinged the customer service at some restaurants, giving customers another reason to eat at home instead.  ""The American public maybe learned eating at home is nice,"" he said. ""You spend a lot of time at home with your family and it\'s more economical.""  He said recent data backs up the stickiness of food at home patterns, too. Receipts at food and beverage stores rose by 0.6% in June versus the prior month, according to data from the Commerce Department. On the other hand, restaurant dining is still down 8% in July compared with a year ago, based on OpenTable reservations that track seated diners from online, phone and walk-in reservations.  However, not all pandemic beneficiaries saw their fortunes change on Monday. Shares of Walmart , Home Depot and Lowe\'s fell on Monday.  Yarbrough chalked that up to Walmart selling general merchandise and discretionary items, rather than being a pure-play grocer. And, he said, investors may anticipate retailers that fare better during the delta variant\'s spread could look different as the government takes different measures. Instead of shutting down non-essential retailers, for instance, local officials may bring back mask mandates and consumers may decide on their own to skip or reduce outings to restaurants. That would mean less dramatic sales gains for home improvement retailers, which were able to stay open during lockdowns as essential retailers, he said.  Yarbrough said he remains convinced that dining out will return at the expense of grocery sales. Yet he said that may take longer to play out — and could be interrupted by spikes in Covid cases.  ""With the delta variant being out there, that may cause some scare among people to say \'You know what, I\'m going to start staying at home. We started going back out to dinner, but we\'re going to start eating at home for awhile until this passes,\'"" he said.', 'LOS ANGELES, July 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Dr.FORHAIR, a leading provider of scalp and hair care solutions, today announced the success of the recent release its signature product Folligen Original Shampoo in the U.S. for the first time through an official partnership with Costco Online.

The market may not go up every year or always outperform other asset classes, such as gold or bonds, but its average annual return runs circles around the average yearly return of other assets.  But over the past decade, this thesis of stock-market superiority has been called into question by the rise of cryptocurrencies. In particular, retail investors have flocked to joke-based digital currency Dogecoin (DOGE 1.36%), which gained as much as 27,000% in a six-month stretch between early November and early May.  Dogecoin is a dud because it lacks competitive advantages  In the eyes of Dogecoin optimists, their meme coin is the future world\'s currency. They believe they\'re getting in well before broad-based adoption occurs. But there\'s one glaring problem with their thesis: The ""people\'s currency,"" as Dogecoin came to be known, has absolutely no competitive advantages.  Dogecoin ""hodlers"" (holders of the token) regularly point to its lower relative transaction fees to the Big Two in crypto, Bitcoin and Ethereum. But that overlooks the other side of the equation. A number of other popular cryptocurrencies charge a fraction of what Dogecoin does per transaction (or perhaps nothing at all). In no particular order, these include: Nano, Ripple, IOTA, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Ethereum Classic, DigiByte, Qtum, Monero, Dash, Cardano, Stellar, and Litecoin; the list goes on, but we\'d be here for a long time if I continued.  If Dogecoin\'s transaction fees aren\'t an advantage in the crypto space, then it must have an impressive validation and settlement time, right? Nope. Nano, Ripple, and Stellar, just to name a few, validate and settle transactions on their respective blockchains in a matter of seconds.  If you think Dogecoin\'s advantage is in handling volume on its blockchain network, you\'d also be mistaken. At its peak, Dogecoin\'s blockchain is reportedly capable of 40 transactions per second. Meanwhile, payment processing kingpin Visa can process 24,000 transactions each second -- or roughly the same number of transactions occurring on Dogecoin\'s blockchain in an entire day. Within the crypto space, Stellar claims to be able to process 3,000 transactions per second. No matter how you slice the data, Dogecoin has no edge.  It doesn\'t even have an advantage as an inflation hedge. Cryptocurrency mining of Dogecoin is increasing the token count by a little over 4% in 2021. It\'s been more than a decade since the U.S. has regularly seen 4% or greater inflation.  Unlike Dogecoin, these stocks have real-world competitive advantages  The fact is that Dogecoin is nothing more than a hyped asset with virtually no real-world utility. The good news is that you can choose to put your money to work in stocks that do offer tangible competitive edges -- and they\'ll likely make you far more money than Dogecoin ever will. The following trio of companies should excel over the long run due to their plain-as-day competitive advantages.  Sirius XM  Want to know one of the easiest ways to lock up a competitive edge? The answer is to be the only company allowed to operate in a particular space. Sirius XM (SIRI 0.75%) is effectively a legal monopoly, as the only satellite-radio operator. While it\'s not devoid of competition, its role as the lone satellite provider gives it a number of advantages.  Arguably the biggest edge for Sirius XM is the company\'s operating model. The company\'s online and terrestrial radio competitors are predominantly reliant on advertising to generate revenue. Meanwhile, Sirius XM brings in most of its sales from subscriptions. This distinction is important, because inevitable periods of economic contractions or recessions often lead to advertising dollars disappearing quickly. By comparison, subscription churn rate doesn\'t budge much, if at all, during recessions. This means Sirius XM is well-insulated against downturns in the economy and is better-positioned than other radio providers.  Furthermore, Sirius XM\'s satellite network also benefits from a handful of nearly fixed costs. Although paying for talent and royalties can vary from quarter to quarter, the company\'s transmission and equipment expenses are virtually static. No matter how many new subscribers Sirius XM signs up, these expenses don\'t really move. That\'s a recipe for higher operating margins as the company\'s subscriber base grows over time.  Costco Wholesale  Another well-known company with clear-cut competitive advantages that could make investors rich is warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST 1.60%). Costco is currently riding a 12-year total return winning streak, which is a fancy way of saying that, including dividends, it hasn\'t had a down year since 2008.  Sometimes, size matters. In Costco\'s case, the company uses its large size and deep pockets to purchase goods in bulk. Buying in bulk allows Costco to pay less per unit purchased, which in turn lets the company undercut grocery chains on the price for a number of regularly purchased staples. Even though groceries provide very low margins, the price discount Costco nets from buying in bulk helps it to drive new and existing members into its stores. If these members buy higher-margin discretionary items, too, it\'s a win.  The membership model also provides key benefits for Costco. The fees the company collects from annual memberships help to fatten up its margins, while ensuring it continues to undercut local grocers on price. Additionally, paying for the right to shop at Costco gives consumers an incentive to stay within the Costco ecosystem of products and services. This drives customer loyalty and higher annual spending.  Alphabet  No discussion of competitive advantages would be complete without mentioning Alphabet (GOOGL 1.26%) (GOOG 1.05%), the parent company of Google and YouTube.  If you want utter dominance, take a closer look at how much internet search traffic is routed through Google. According to data from GlobalStats, Google has controlled between 91% and 93% of worldwide internet search over the trailing year. The next-closest competitor is Microsoft\'s Bing, at just over a 2% share. With this high a share of global internet search traffic, it should come as no surprise that advertisers are lining up and willing to pay big bucks for placement on Google\'s search platform.  The crazy thing about Alphabet is that two of its ancillary projects have also blossomed into massive businesses. Streaming content platform YouTube is one of the three most-visited social sites in the world. Meanwhile, Google Cloud has grown into one of the three largest cloud infrastructure service platforms. Between steady double-digit growth from Google and considerably faster sales growth from YouTube and Cloud, Alphabet\'s operating cash flow is set to skyrocket.']","[""Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading.

Sculley On What To Look For: If Sculley were looking for companies to invest in, he would look for companies that are inventing new industries or offering new science or technology that reimagines existing industries, he told Benzinga.  Such companies often have a leadership team that is ""insatiably curious,"" willing to take risks and able to recruit great talent, Sculley said. The leadership team should also possess a passion for whatever it is they do, he added.  The way to bring in really talented people is to have talented CEO leadership at the top, he said.  ""It\'s all about talent,"" Sculley told Benzinga.  Tickers Mentioned In The Interview: Celularity Inc (NASDAQ:CELU), Zeta Global Holdings Corp (NYSE:ZETA)', 'PepsiCo and Conagra Brands said Tuesday they plan to pass along higher input costs to customers as inflation accelerates.  Earlier in the day, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index jumped 5.4% in June compared with a year ago. It\'s the biggest monthly gain since August 2008. Food prices rose 0.8%.  The Federal Reserve\'s current position is that these inflationary pressures are ""transitory,"" although the central bank\'s New York district found that consumers have different expectations. Maybe that\'s because they\'ll soon see higher prices on products like Slim Jim jerky and Orville Redenbacher popcorn, which are owned by Conagra.  Conagra CEO Sean Connolly said in a statement that the company has upgraded its existing plans to respond to higher input costs. He explained that inflation accelerated during the fiscal fourth quarter ended May 30, leading the company to expect materially higher costs than it did at the end of its fiscal third quarter in late February.  ""While we are pleased with the initial results, there will be a lag between the time we are hit with higher costs and when we realize the benefits of our actions,"" Connolly said.  The delay is expected to hit Conagra\'s results over the next six months, leading the company to cut its fiscal 2022 forecast. The news hit Conagra\'s stock, dragging shares down by more than 4% despite the company reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue. The stock has fallen 5% this year, lowering its market value to $16.5 billion.  Pepsi is also seeing higher costs for some ingredients, freight and labor. During a conference call Tuesday, CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts that the company thinks it can manage the higher costs through a combination of higher prices and increased productivity. CFO Hugh Johnston said Pepsi expects to keep hiking prices after Labor Day.  Pepsi executives made similar comments on the prior quarter\'s conference call, although inflation has accelerated since then. Luckily for Pepsi, its ingredient basket is diverse, and no single commodity accounts for more than a tenth of the basket.  Shares of the beverage and snack maker rose more than 2% to reach an all-time high after the company\'s second-quarter earnings crushed Wall Street\'s estimates. The company also raised its forecast as consumers returned to restaurants and movie theaters. The stock is up 3% this year, giving it a market value of $212 billion. That\'s nearly 13 times the valuation of Conagra.  Inflation is also trickling down to another kind of food buyer: restaurants. Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol said Tuesday on CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" that the burrito chain is seeing some cost pressure.  ""Whether or not that is permanent in some of the key inputs for our business is to be determined, but I think the positive is that the supply chain is starting to break through some of the bottlenecks that we were battling throughout Covid,"" he said.']"
